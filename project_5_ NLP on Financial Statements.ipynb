    "## Instructions\n",
    "Each problem consists of a function to implement and instructions on how to implement the function.  The parts of the function that need to be implemented are marked with a `# TODO` comment. After implementing the function, run the cell to test it against the unit tests we've provided. For each problem, we provide one or more unit tests from our `project_tests` package. These unit tests won't tell you if your answer is correct, but will warn you of any major errors. Your code will be checked for the correct solution when you submit it to Udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "When you implement the functions, you'll only need to you use the packages you've used in the classroom, like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). These packages will be imported for you. We recommend you don't add any import statements, otherwise the grader might not be able to run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other packages that we're importing are `project_helper` and `project_tests`. These are custom packages built to help you solve the problems.  The `project_helper` module contains utility functions and graph functions. The `project_tests` contains the unit tests for all the problems.\n",

-----------------------------------------\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb, for the most part, purchases the principal raw\\nmaterials and supplies used in each industry segment in the open market.\\nSubstantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so\\nthat the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse\\neffect on the Company.\\n\\n\\nPATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES\\n- --------------------------------\\n\\nThe Company owns or is licensed under a number of patents in the United\\nStates and foreign countries covering products, principally in the\\npharmaceuticals and medical devices segments, and has also developed many\\nbrand names and trademarks for products in each industry segment.  The\\nCompany considers the overall protection of its patent, trademark and license\\nrights to be of material value and acts to protect these rights from\\ninfringement.  The Company believes that no single patent or license is of\\nmaterial importance in relation to the business as a whole.\\n\\n\\nCOMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS\\n- ---------------------------------------\\n\\nThe markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad based,\\nheavily competitive and include many competitors.  The principal means of\\ncompetition utilized to market the products of Bristol-Myers Squibb include\\nquality, service, price and product performance.  The products of the\\npharmaceuticals segment and the medical devices segment are promoted on a\\nnational and international basis in medical journals and directly to the\\nmedical profession.  The Company is also utilizing direct-to-consumer\\nadvertising for a number of its pharmaceutical products.  Most of the other\\nproducts of Bristol-Myers Squibb are generally advertised and promoted on a\\nnational and international basis through the use of television, radio, print\\nmedia, consumer offers, and window and in-store displays.  Bristol-Myers\\nSquibb\\'s products are principally sold to the wholesale and retail trade both\\nnationally and internationally.  Certain products of the pharmaceuticals and\\nmedical devices segments are also sold to other drug manufacturers, hospitals\\nand the medical profession.  None of the segments is dependent upon a single\\ncustomer, or a few customers, such that the loss of any one or more would\\nhave a material adverse effect on the segment.\\n\\n\\n                                        6\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\\n- ------------------------\\n\\nResearch and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s businesses,\\nparticularly to the Pharmaceuticals Segment.  Management continues to place\\ngreat emphasis on these activities. Pharmaceutical research and development\\nis carried out by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute\\nwhich has major facilities in Princeton, Hopewell and New Brunswick, New\\nJersey; and Wallingford, Connecticut. Pharmaceutical research and development\\nis also carried out at various other facilities in the United States and in\\nBelgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,385 million in 1997, $1,276 million in 1996 and\\n$1,199 million in 1995 on company sponsored research and development\\nactivities.  Pharmaceutical research and development spending, as a percentage\\nof pharmaceutical sales, was 12.0% in 1997 compared to 12.3% in 1996 and 12.9%\\nin 1995.\\n\\n\\nREGULATION\\n- ----------\\n\\nMost aspects of the Company\\'s business are subject to some degree of\\ngovernment regulation in the countries in which its operations are conducted.\\nThe Company\\'s policy is to comply fully with all regulatory requirements\\napplying to its products and operations.  For some products, and in some\\ncountries, government regulation is significant and, in general, there is a\\ntrend to more stringent regulation.  The Company devotes significant time,\\neffort and expense addressing the extensive governmental regulatory\\nrequirements applicable to its business.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\\n\\nBreast Implant Litigation\\n- -------------------------\\n\\nReference is made to Note 16 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual\\nReport.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 1997, approximately 23,000 domestic and 1,300 foreign\\nbreast implant recipients were plaintiffs in lawsuits pending in federal and\\nstate courts in the United States and in certain courts in Canada and\\nAustralia.  Of the 23,000 domestic plaintiffs, about 12,300 have opted out of\\nthe class action settlement described below.  The remaining 10,700 plaintiffs\\nhave chosen to participate in the settlement, and their lawsuits are expected\\nto be dismissed.  Some 400 foreign breast implant recipients have opted out\\nof the Revised Settlement but the opt-out period has not yet expired for\\nforeign women.  Only those suits filed by plaintiffs who have opted out of\\nthe class action settlement may proceed in the United States.  Appeals\\nrelated to the Revised Settlement are pending.\\n\\nOther manufacturers of breast implants, as well as suppliers of component\\nparts and other parties, are also defendants in the majority of these cases.\\nSome of these plaintiffs have sued numerous manufacturers without specifying\\nthe manufacturer of the implants involved.\\n\\nIn addition to individual suits, the Company has been named as a defendant,\\ntogether with other defendants, in a purported class action brought on behalf\\nof children allegedly exposed to silicone in utero and through breast milk.\\n(FEUER, ET AL., V. MCGHAN, ET AL., U.S.D.C, E. Dist. NY, 93-0146.)   The\\nsuit, which has not been certified as a class action, names all breast\\nimplant manufacturers as defendants and seeks to establish a medical\\nmonitoring fund.  On April 11, 1996, a class action on behalf of all women in\\nthe Canadian province of British Columbia was certified in the provincial\\ncourt of British Columbia on the single issue of whether silicone gel breast\\nimplants are reasonably fit for their intended purpose (HARRINGTON V. DOW\\nCORNING CORPORATION ET AL., Supreme Court, British Columbia, C954330).  A\\npreviously certified class action lawsuit entitled IN RE: LOUISIANA BREAST\\nIMPLANT CLASS ACTION (previously SPITZFADEN, ET AL. VS. DOW CORNING CORP., ET\\nAL.), No. 92-2589, was decertified by the trial court in December 1997 and is\\nnot expected to proceed as a class action.\\n\\nThe Company is a participant in a class action settlement approved by the\\nHonorable Sam C. Pointer, Jr., Chief Judge of the United States District\\nCourt for the Northern District of Alabama (LINDSEY, ET AL., V. DOW CORNING,\\nET AL., CV-94-P-11558-S), before whom all federal breast implant cases were\\nconsolidated for pretrial purposes.  On December 22, 1995, Judge Pointer\\napproved a revised settlement program (Revised Settlement) for resolution of\\nclaims seeking damages for personal injuries from allegedly defective breast\\nimplants.  The Revised Settlement arises out of a class action settlement\\napproved by the Court on September 1, 1994.  On January 16, 1996, the\\nCompany, Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Baxter International\\n(collectively, Baxter), and Minnesota, Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M)\\n(hereinafter, the Settling Defendants) each paid $125 million into a court-\\nestablished fund as an initial reserve to pay claims under the Revised\\nSettlement.  In 1997, the Company made additional contributions to the court-\\nestablished fund totaling approximately $190 million.  McGhan Medical\\nCorporation and Union Carbide Corporation are also parties to the Revised\\nSettlement.\\n\\n\\n                                        9\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nThe fifteen-year Revised Settlement program provides benefits to those breast\\nimplant recipients who have had at least one breast implant manufactured by\\none of the Settling Defendants (or their predecessors or subsidiaries).\\nSeveral kinds of benefits are available for eligible participants with breast\\nimplants made by companies affiliated with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter and\\n3M: (1) for current claimants, compensation generally ranging from $10,000 to\\n$50,000 based on disease and disability definitions of the original\\nsettlement, plus supplemental benefits of an additional $15,000 to $50,000\\nfor claimants with ruptured implants; (2) for current claimants seeking\\nhigher benefits and for other registrants, compensation ranging from $75,000\\nto $250,000 based on more stringent disease and disability definitions (Long-\\nTerm Benefits); and (3) although the Settling Defendants are not recommending\\nremoval of implants absent some specific medical reason, a $3,000 payment for\\nthose class members (other than late registrants) who seek removal of\\nimplants.  In addition, current claimants are eligible for an advance payment\\nof $5,000, and other registrants are eligible for an advance payment of\\n$1,000.  For current claimants, benefits would be payable regardless of the\\nnumber of claimants seeking compensation, regardless of the total dollar\\nvalue of approved claims, and regardless of the outcome of appeals from the\\norder approving the settlement.  For other registrants, benefits would be\\nsubject to an aggregate $755 million limit for all participating companies\\nover the fifteen-year life of the program.  The Company\\'s individual\\naggregate limit for such benefits is $400 million.  In the event the dollar\\nvalue of the future claims subject to the limit exceeds this amount,\\nclaimants may be afforded additional opt-out rights but without the right to\\nassert punitive or other statutory multiple damage claims.  The Company\\'s\\nobligations to make payments under the Revised Settlement are not affected by\\nthe number of class members electing to opt out of the settlement or the\\nnumber of class members making claims under it.  However, the Company\\'s\\nobligations to fund Long-Term Benefits are cancelable if certain provisions\\nof the Revised Settlement are disapproved on appeal.\\n\\nThe Revised Settlement was the subject of an appeal filed by certain foreign\\nbreast implant recipients.  In November 1996, the Settling Defendants settled\\nthat appeal, and the benefits of the Revised Settlement were extended, with\\ncertain modifications, to foreign breast implant recipients.  Pursuant to the\\nsettlement, the Settling Defendants paid (on an equal basis) an aggregate of\\n$25 million into a court-approved settlement fund as an initial reserve for\\npayment of foreign claims.\\n\\nApproximately 380,000 domestic class members (with implants of all\\nmanufacturers, not just MEC, Baxter and 3M) registered with the original\\nsettlement approved in 1994.  Around 88,000 of these class members have\\nindicated that they received at least one breast implant manufactured by MEC\\nor a related company.  Of these 88,000 registrants, 14,300 have opted out of\\nthe Revised Settlement;  6,300 of these have proved to the satisfaction of\\nthe claims office that they received a breast implant of MEC or a related\\ncompany, while the remaining 8,000 opt-outs have indicated their belief (but\\nhave not proved) that they received an MEC breast implant.  The 14,300 opt-\\nouts who have or claim to have MEC implants are among the 44,800 domestic\\nregistrants (with implants of all manufacturers) who opted out of the Revised\\nSettlement.  The Company has identified approximately 10,800 persons from\\namong the 44,800 opt-outs (with implants of all defendants, not just MEC) as\\nplaintiffs in lawsuits against it.  An as yet undetermined number of these\\n10,800 plaintiffs do not have MEC implants and their claims against the\\nCompany are expected to be dismissed.  An additional 1,570 plaintiffs with\\nclaims based upon MEC implants remain from among domestic class members who\\n\\n\\n                                        10\\n<PAGE>\\n\\npreviously opted out of the settlement originally approved in 1994.  Because\\nthe opt-out period is essentially over for domestic class members, the number\\nof opt-outs is not expected to increase materially.  However, because of\\ncontinuing uncertainties, it is still not possible to predict on any precise\\nbasis the total number of women with MEC implants who will pursue lawsuits\\nagainst the Company.\\n\\nThe cost of the settlement is dependent upon complex and varying factors,\\nincluding the number of class members that participate, the kinds of claims\\nasserted and approved under the settlement, and their dollar value.  In light\\nof the continuing uncertainties attendant to these and other factors, it is\\nnot possible to achieve any precision at this time in estimating the cost of\\nthe settlement to the Company.\\n\\nIn May of 1996, the Company, together with other Settling Defendants, entered\\ninto a $50 million settlement of claims asserted by certain health insurers\\nbased upon payments made or benefits provided by insurers and represented\\nhealth plans to participating registrants that allegedly involve or relate to\\nsilicone gel breast implants.  The Company has paid $20.2 million to the\\nsettlement, which extinguishes the potential claims of the majority of the\\nU.S. commercial and non-governmental health care insurer market against both\\nthe defendants and settlement class members.\\n\\nIn July of 1995, the Company entered into a $20.5 million (U.S. funds) class\\naction settlement with plaintiff representatives in the provinces of Ontario\\nand Quebec.  The class includes persons who have or had MEC breast implants\\nand who reside in Ontario and Quebec or who received their MEC implants\\nthere.  The settlement, which had minimal opt-outs, has been approved by the\\nprovincial courts of Ontario and Quebec.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s insurers were notified of the breast implant claims and the\\nRevised Settlement, and generally reserved their rights or declined to\\nconfirm coverage.  The Company has reached settlements with many of the\\ninsurers (generally in connection with coverage litigation filed by the\\nCompany in Texas state court).  The settlement agreements provided cash or\\nconfirmed coverage.  Legal proceedings remain unresolved against some of the\\ninsurers.\\n\\nThe cost to the Company of resolving opt-out claims is subject to a number of\\ncomplex uncertainties.  Primary among them is the difficulty of estimating\\nwith any precision the quantity and quality of such claims.  While there have\\nbeen large judgments, defendants have won more trials than they have lost,\\nand in 1996 and 1997, the Company\\'s trial experience was highly favorable.\\nThe Company has maintained throughout this litigation that breast implants do\\nnot cause disease and medical and scientific data support the Company\\'s\\nposition.  The Company\\'s view has found strong support in the December 1996\\ndecision of a federal judge in Oregon, who ruled to exclude the testimony of\\nplaintiffs\\' experts concerning a causal link between silicone gel breast\\nimplants and systemic illness on the ground that it fails to satisfy\\nstandards for reliability under current Supreme Court guidelines.  In\\naddition, a science panel appointed by Judge Pointer is in the process of\\nreviewing the scientific literature regarding any relation between breast\\nimplants and disease, and is expected to report its findings in 1998.   The\\nresults of continuing medical research and a variety of additional factors,\\nincluding the success of other legal defenses and the success of the Revised\\nSettlement program, might substantially affect the cost of resolving opt-out\\ncases.\\n\\n\\n                                        11\\n\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a charge of $500 million\\nbefore taxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant cases.\\nThe charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses,\\noffset by $1 billion of expected insurance proceeds.  In the fourth quarters\\nof 1994 and 1995, the Company recorded additional special charges of $750\\nmillion before taxes ($488 million after taxes) and $950 million before taxes\\n($590 million after taxes), respectively, related to breast implant product\\nliability claims.  Although the cost of the Revised Settlement and the\\nongoing litigation cannot at present be predicted with any reasonable degree\\nof precision, the Company, based on the information set forth above and on\\nrelated estimates, continues to believe that previously established reserves\\nshould be adequate to address these claims.\\n\\nInfant Formula Matters\\n- ----------------------\\n\\nThe Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are or have been defendants\\nin a number of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of\\npurported statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula products\\nand by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi,\\nalleging a price fixing conspiracy and other violations of state antitrust or\\ndeceptive trade practice laws and seeking penalties and other relief.  The\\nCompany has previously reported reaching settlements and receiving final\\ncourt approval in the majority of these cases.  The only open cases are in\\nLouisiana and Missouri.  On November 6, 1997, the court in Louisiana\\ndismissed the plaintiffs\\' case.  The plaintiffs are appealing that dismissal.\\nIn Missouri, the Company has a motion to dismiss pending. The Company\\nbelieves that these actions are without merit and that their ultimate\\ndisposition will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s results\\nof operations, liquidity or consolidated financial position.\\n\\nPrescription Drug Litigation\\n- ----------------------------\\n\\nAs of December 31, 1997, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions\\nbrought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical\\nmanufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various\\nfederal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains and\\nindependent drugstores, suing either individually or as a representative of\\na nationwide class of retail pharmacies that has been certified.  These\\ncases, which have been coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States\\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Illinois, seek treble damages and\\ninjunctive relief on account of an alleged antitrust conspiracy concerning\\nthe pricing and marketing of brand name prescription drugs in violation of\\nthe Sherman Act; individual retailer plaintiffs also assert claims of\\nunlawful price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act.  Discovery has\\nbeen completed with respect to claims concerning the alleged Sherman Act\\nviolations.  Completion of additional discovery with respect to Robinson-\\nPatman Act claims against the Company has been stayed.  It is estimated that\\nthe class members who have not opted out represent approximately two-thirds\\nof retail pharmacy purchases of brand name prescription drugs during the\\nalleged damages period.  As of May 1, 1996, the Company, without admitting\\nany wrongdoing, reached an amended agreement to settle the class action.  On\\nMay 30, 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\\ndismissed appeals challenging the District Court\\'s approval of the amended\\nclass action settlement.  On October 29, 1997, the class settlement became\\nfinal.  Trial in the class case against the manufacturer and wholesaler\\ndefendants who have not settled is scheduled for September 14, 1998, with\\ntrial in the actions brought by the individual retailer plaintiffs to follow.\\nThe largest opt-out retailer plaintiffs have purported to quantify their\\n\\n\\n                                        12\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nSherman Act damage claims against the defendants, including the Company,\\nasserting damages aggregating approximately $2.4 billion before trebling.  On\\nNovember 20, 1997, two large retail chains, Eckerd Corporation and American\\nDrug Stores, initiated similar actions in the Northern District of Illinois\\nagainst several manufacturer and wholesaler defendants, including the\\nCompany.  On August 15, 1997, the Seventh Circuit ruled on consolidated\\nappeals from several District Court rulings.  The Appeals Court reversed the\\nDistrict Court\\'s denial of summary judgment to the manufacturer defendants,\\nincluding the Company, on the overcharge damages claims based on plaintiffs\\'\\nindirect purchases from wholesalers of defendant manufacturers\\' drugs.\\nHowever, the Court of Appeals also reversed the District Court\\'s grant of\\nsummary judgment to the wholesaler defendants in the class action and stated\\nthat class and individual plaintiffs might be able to recover overcharge\\ndamages on indirect purchases from wholesalers if they demonstrated that\\nwholesalers participated in the alleged Sherman Act violations.  After\\nremand, the District Court granted the individual plaintiffs leave to amend\\ntheir complaints to join the wholesalers as defendants.  Class action cases\\nbrought by retail pharmacies in state courts against similar defendants\\nincluding the Company and alleging similar claims under state law have been\\nfiled in California, Alabama, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Mississippi.  Final\\nsettlements have been approved in the Wisconsin and Minnesota class actions.\\nThe Mississippi court has ruled that the case may not proceed as a class\\naction, but has refused to dismiss the claims of named plaintiffs.  Class\\naction cases brought by consumers in state courts against similar defendants\\nincluding the Company and alleging similar claims under state law have been\\nbrought in Alabama, California, Washington, New York, Arizona, the District\\nof Columbia, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Kansas, Florida,\\nTennessee and North Carolina.  Four of these state consumer cases were\\nremoved to federal court and transferred to the consolidated proceedings in\\nthe Northern District of Illinois.  These four cases have recently been\\nremanded to state court and all the consumer class actions are now in state\\ncourt.  The consumer actions brought in Washington and New York have been\\ndismissed; an appeal is pending in New York.  A consumer class has been\\ncertified in the District of Columbia case, while class certification has\\nbeen denied in the Maine, Michigan and Minnesota consumer cases.  Plaintiffs\\nin Minnesota responded to the denial of class certification by filing a new\\nconsumer class action seeking only injunctive relief on August 14, 1997.  In\\nJuly 1996, the Company received a subpoena from the Federal Trade Commission\\n(FTC) in an investigation it is conducting to determine whether U.S.\\npharmaceutical manufacturers have engaged in unfair methods of competition by\\nengaging in unlawful concerted activities on prices of pharmaceutical\\nproducts.  On May 27, 1997, the FTC served a second subpoena and a Civil\\nInvestigative Demand (CID) on the Company for information and documents.  The\\nCompany responded to this CID and has completed its document production.  On\\nDecember 31, 1997, the FTC requested additional documents.  The Company\\nbelieves that the above-described actions are without merit and that their\\nultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s\\nresults of operations, liquidity or consolidated financial position.\\n\\nEnvironmental Matters\\n- ---------------------\\n\\nThe Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in,\\na number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection Agency or\\ncomparable state agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\\nCompensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or comparable state laws\\ndirected at the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.  While it is not possible\\nto predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, the Company believes\\nthat the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material\\n\\n\\n                                        13\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nadverse effect on the Company\\'s results of operations, liquidity or\\nconsolidated financial position.\\n\\n\\n\\nItem 4.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL\\nCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nIn 1997, Bristol-Myers Squibb achieved record levels of sales, earnings and\\nearnings per share. Worldwide sales grew to $16.7 billion, an 11% increase\\nover 1996.  Domestic sales, which represent 58% of worldwide sales, increased\\n14% to $9.6 billion, while international sales increased 7% to $7.1 billion.\\nExchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable effect of 3% on worldwide sales\\nand 8% on international sales.  Sales growth resulted from a 14% increase due\\nto volume with no changes overall from pricing activity.  In 1997,\\nsignificant contributions to the Company\\'s sales growth were made by the\\nCompany\\'s most important products, many of which experienced double- and even\\ntriple-digit sales growth on a worldwide basis.\\n\\nEarnings before income taxes increased 12% to $4,482 million in 1997, net\\nearnings increased 12% to $3,205 million, basic earnings per share increased\\n13% to $3.22 and diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $3.14.  Net\\nearnings and basic earnings per share have increased at compound annual\\ngrowth rates of 12% and 13%, respectively, over the past 10 years.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb\\'s financial position remains strong.  At December 31,\\n1997, the Company held $1.8 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable\\nsecurities.  Cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.5 billion and\\ncontinued to be the primary source of funding to finance dividend\\ndistributions of $1.5 billion and treasury stock repurchases of $1.2 billion.\\nDividends per common share were $1.52 in 1997, increasing from $1.50 per\\nshare paid in 1996.  The Company\\'s payout ratio, calculated as dividends per\\ncommon share over basic earnings per common share, were 47.2%, 52.8% and\\n57.6%, in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, excluding the 1995 special\\ncharge and provision for restructuring.  In December 1997, the Company\\nannounced another dividend increase, the twenty-sixth consecutive year that\\ndividends have increased.  The 1998 indicated annual payment is $1.56 per\\nshare.  Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s strong financial position is evidenced further\\nby its triple-A credit rating from both Moody\\'s and Standard & Poor\\'s, making\\nBristol-Myers Squibb one of only seven U.S. companies with this distinction.\\n\\nIn 1997, Bristol-Myers Squibb established its long-term strategic objective\\nto be the number one company in earnings per share growth within its\\ncompetitive universe.  To achieve this objective, the Company is making\\nstrategic investments behind a number of high priority projects.  The\\nCompany\\'s top priority project is to become the most productive, respected\\nand innovative pharmaceutical research and development organization in the\\nworld.  Other high priority projects focus on high growth products in fast\\ngrowing markets, including PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*(R) (paclitaxel), GLUCOPHAGE and\\nHERBAL ESSENCES*, as well as enhancing the balanced strength of its core\\nbusinesses.  During 1997, increases were made in advertising and promotion\\nexpenditures, sales force personnel and research and development facilities\\nand personnel to help ensure the success of these high priority projects.\\n\\nTotal equity market capitalization was $94 billion as of December 31, 1997,\\na 72.3% increase over last year.

The consolidated\\nsales growth resulted from a 14% increase due to volume, a 3% decrease due to\\nunfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations and no changes overall from\\npricing activity.  In 1996, the 9% increase in sales reflected an 11%\\nincrease due to volume, a 2% decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange\\nrate fluctuations and no changes overall from pricing activity.  In 1995, the\\n15% increase in sales reflected a 13% increase due to volume, while price\\nincreases and exchange rate fluctuations each contributed 1% to growth on a\\nworldwide basis.  Domestic sales increased 14% in 1997, and 10% in both 1996\\nand 1995, while international sales increased 7% in 1997, 9% in 1996 and 22%\\nin 1995.

Excluding\\nthe 1995 special charge and provision for restructuring, the effective income\\ntax rate on earnings before income taxes was 29.0% in 1995.  The lower 1997\\neffective income tax rate compared to 1996 and 1995 resulted from increased\\nincome in lower tax rate jurisdictions.\\n\\nAs described in the notes to the financial statements, in the fourth quarter\\nof 1997, the Company divested Linvatec Corporation, its arthroscopy and\\nsurgical powered instrument business, for $370 million, resulting in a gain\\nof $225 million before taxes, $140 million after taxes.  At the same time,\\nthe Company recorded a provision for restructuring of $225 million before\\ntaxes, $140 million after taxes.  The provision for restructuring primarily\\nrelates to the consolidation of plants and facilities and related employee\\ntermination costs.  In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company recorded a\\nspecial charge to earnings of $950 million before taxes, $590 million after\\ntaxes, or $.58 per common share, basic and diluted (see Note 16 -\\nContingencies), as well as a provision for restructuring of $310 million\\nbefore taxes, $198 million after taxes.\\n\\n\\n                                        24\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nExpenses\\n\\nTotal costs and expenses as a percentage of sales were 73.2% in 1997 compared\\nwith 73.4% in both 1996 and 1995, excluding the 1995 special charge and\\nprovision for restructuring.\\n\\nAs a percentage of sales, cost of products sold increased to 26.7% in 1997\\nfrom 26.3% in 1996, principally due to incremental low margin Oncology\\nTherapeutic Network sales, partially offset by increased sales of higher\\nmargin promoted pharmaceutical products.  In 1996, cost of products sold as\\na percentage of sales remained relatively unchanged at 26.3% compared to\\n26.4% in 1995.  Excluding 1996 acquisitions, cost of products sold as a\\npercentage of sales decreased to 25.5% in 1996 due to a favorable product mix\\nand manufacturing efficiencies.\\n\\nAdvertising and promotion expenses in support of new and existing products\\nincreased 15% to $2,241 million in 1997 from $1,946 million in 1996, and as\\na percentage of sales, increased to 13.5% from 12.9%, principally due to\\nincreased spending on direct-to-consumer campaigns for several pharmaceutical\\nproducts as well as incremental advertising support of beauty care products.\\nIn 1996, advertising and promotion expenses increased 18% from 1995 levels\\nprimarily due to incremental spending in the Pharmaceuticals and Beauty Care\\nSegments, supporting direct-to-consumer campaigns and new product launches,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 6% to $4,173 million\\nin 1997 from $3,925 million in 1996, and as a percentage of sales, decreased\\nto 25.0% in 1997 from 26.1% in 1996 and 26.7% in 1995 as a direct result of\\nthe Company\\'s productivity programs and higher sales volumes.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s investment in research and development totaled $1,385 million\\nin 1997, an increase of 9% over 1996, and as a percentage of sales, decreased\\nto 8.3% in 1997 from 8.5% in 1996.  This spending level reflects the\\nCompany\\'s commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and\\nclinical development in support of new products.  The Company acquired a new\\nresearch facility in Hopewell, N.J., and announced its intention to hire\\n2,000 additional scientists over the next several years.  Over the past 10\\nyears, research and development expenses have increased at a compound annual\\ngrowth rate of 10%.  In 1997, research and development spending dedicated to\\nthe research and development of pharmaceutical products was 12.0% of\\npharmaceutical sales compared to 12.3% and 12.9% in 1996 and 1995,\\nrespectively.  During 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company entered into a number\\nof research alliances, licensing agreements and biotechnology collaborations.\\nThese agreements are providing important new products as well as early-stage\\ncompounds for further development and new processes that will help the\\nCompany screen for new drugs more effectively.\\n\\nBusiness Segments\\n\\nAll five of the Company\\'s business segments - Pharmaceuticals, Consumer\\nMedicines, Nutritionals, Medical Devices and Beauty Care - reported sales\\nincreases, excluding foreign exchange, during the year.

Sales\\ngrowth resulted from a 17% increase in volume and a 1% increase in selling\\nprices, offset by a 3% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign\\nexchange rate fluctuations.  Domestic sales increased 23% and international\\nsales increased 13%, excluding foreign exchange, primarily due to volume\\ngrowth.\\n\\nSales of PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol-lowering agent, and the Company\\'s largest\\nselling product, were $1.4 billion, an increase of 34%.  Domestic sales\\nincreased 39% to $875 million.

Sales of MONOPRIL*, a second generation\\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with once-a-day dosing,\\nincreased 28% to $328 million, with strong growth in both domestic and\\ninternational markets.  The Company and Sanofi S.A. received U.S. marketing\\nclearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for irbesartan and\\nclopidogrel.  Irbesartan, sold as AVAPRO in the United States, is an\\nangiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, and\\nclopidogrel, to be sold as PLAVIX in the United States, is a platelet\\ninhibitor for the reduction of stroke and heart attack in patients with\\natherosclerosis.  AVAPRO was launched in the United States during the fourth\\nquarter, and PLAVIX is planned to launch in early 1998.  Sales of\\ncardiovascular drugs, the largest product group in the segment, increased 3%\\nto $2,905 million.  Due to the loss of patent exclusivity in several European\\ncountries in the first quarter of 1997, and in the United States in February\\n1996, sales of captopril, an ACE inhibitor sold primarily under the trademark\\nCAPOTEN*, declined $296 million to $795 million.  Excluding CAPOTEN* sales,\\ncardiovascular drugs increased 22%.\\n\\nSales of anti-cancer drugs increased 23% to $2,420 million.  Sales of TAXOL*,\\nthe Company\\'s leading anti-cancer agent, increased 16% to $941 million.  In\\nJune and September 1997, the Company was granted use patents in the United\\nStates covering specific dosage regimes for TAXOL*, and in August 1997, the\\nFDA cleared TAXOL* for use in second-line treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi\\'s\\nsarcoma.  Sales of PARAPLATIN*, which is used in combination therapy for the\\ntreatment of ovarian cancer, increased 17%.  Sales in the Oncology\\nTherapeutics Network (OTN), a specialty distributor of anti-cancer medicines\\nand related products, acquired in October 1996, were $480 million.\\n\\nAnti-infective drug sales were $2,235 million, an increase of 20% over the\\nprior year.

Cash provided by operations\\ncontinued to be the Company\\'s primary source of funds to finance operating\\nneeds and expenditures for new plants and equipment.  As part of the\\nCompany\\'s ongoing commitment to improve plant efficiency and maintain\\nsuperior research facilities, the Company has invested nearly $1.9 billion in\\ncapital expansion over the past three years.\\n\\nCash provided by operations was also used to pay dividends of over $4.5\\nbillion over the past three years, to fund acquisitions at a cost of $920\\nmillion over the last three years, and to finance the share repurchase\\nprogram.  The Company\\'s share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of\\ncommon stock from time to time in the open market or through private\\ntransactions as market conditions permit.  During 1997, the Company purchased\\n16.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1,162 million, bringing the\\ntotal shares acquired since the program\\'s inception to 123 million.

This statement does not change the\\nmeasurement or the recognition of pension and postretirement expenses.  It\\neliminates certain current disclosures, and requires additional disclosures\\nor changes on the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets.\\n\\nSubsequent to year end, the Company entered into two revolving credit\\nfacility agreements totaling $500 million.  They are available for use as\\nneeded for general corporate purposes.\\n\\nThe Company has reviewed its information systems for YEAR 2000 compliance and\\nhas initiated plans to remedy any deficiencies in a timely manner.

The plans also provide for the granting of\\nperformance-based stock options to certain key executives.\\n\\nUnder the terms of the 1983 Stock Option Plan, as amended, additional\\nshares are authorized in the amount of 0.9% of the outstanding shares per\\nyear through 2003 and incorporates the Company\\'s long-term performance\\naward plan.\\n\\nUnder the TeamShare Stock Option Plan, all full-time employees, excluding\\nkey executives, meeting certain years of service requirements are granted\\noptions to purchase the Company\\'s common stock at the market price on the\\ndate the options are granted.  The Company has authorized 30,000,000\\nshares for issuance under the plan.  As of December 31, 1997, a total of\\n21,984,200 options were granted under the plan with generally 400 options\\ngranted to each eligible employee.  Individual grants generally become\\nexercisable on or after the third anniversary of the grant date.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s restricted stock award plan provides for the granting of up\\nto 6,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, subject to\\nrestrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death or\\nnormal retirement.  Restrictions generally expire over a five-year period\\nfrom date of grant.  Compensation expense is recognized over the\\nrestricted period.  At December 31, 1997, a total of 1,253,352 shares were\\noutstanding under the plan.\\n\\nThe Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting\\nfor Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting\\nfor its plans.  Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized\\nfor its stock-based compensation plans other than for restricted stock and\\nperformance-based awards.  Had compensation cost for the Company\\'s other\\nstock option plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant\\ndate for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology\\nprescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,\\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company\\'s net income and\\nbasic earnings per share would have been reduced by approximately $85\\nmillion, or $.09 per common share - basic and $.08 per common share -\\ndiluted, in 1997, $55 million, or $.05 per common share, basic and diluted\\nin 1996 and $35 million, or $.03 per common share, basic and diluted in\\n1995.  The fair value of the options granted during 1997, 1996 and 1995\\nwas estimated as $12.82 per common share, $8.51 per share and $6.47 per\\nshare, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-\\npricing model with the following assumptions:\\n\\n\\n                                        45\\n\\n <PAGE>\\n\\n\\n                     BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n                         (dollars in millions)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                               1997        1996       1995\\n                                              -----       -----      -----\\n\\nDividend yield                                 4.3%        4.3%       4.2%\\nVolatility                                    19.3%       17.0%      18.2%\\nRisk-free interest rate                        6.5%        6.5%       6.9%\\nAssumed forfeiture rate                        3.0%        3.0%       3.0%\\nExpected life (years)                          7           7          7\\n\\n\\nStock option transactions were:\\n                                                                 Weighted\\n                                                                Average of\\n                                    Shares of Common Stock       Exercise\\n                                   --------------------------      Price\\n                                    Available        Under       of Shares\\n                                    for Option        Plan      Under Plan\\n                                   -----------     -----------  ----------\\nBalance, December 31, 1994           4,567,924      21,946,987      $56.99\\nAuthorized                          19,565,572               -

The most significant of these are described below.\\nReference is made to Item 3 Legal Proceedings in Part 1 of this Form 10-K\\nAnnual Report.\\n\\nBreast Implant Litigation\\n- -------------------------\\n\\nAs of December 31, 1997, approximately 24,000 persons were plaintiffs in\\nsuits against the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation\\n(MEC), and certain other subsidiaries, in federal and state courts in the\\nUnited States and in certain courts in Canada and Australia,  alleging\\ndamages for personal injuries of various types resulting from\\npolyurethane-covered breast implants and smooth-walled breast implants.\\nThe Company, MEC and certain other defendants are participants in a\\nsettlement program originally approved on September 1, 1994, and revised\\non December 22, 1995, by the Federal District Court in Birmingham,\\nAlabama.  About 11,000 of these plaintiffs are participating in the\\nrevised settlement, and are expected to discontinue their lawsuits.\\nSeparate class action settlements have been approved in the provincial\\ncourts of Ontario and Quebec, and an agreement has been reached under\\nwhich other foreign breast implant recipients may settle their claims.\\n\\nApproximately 380,000 domestic class members (with implants of all\\nmanufacturers, not just MEC, Baxter and 3M) originally registered with the\\nrevised settlement.  Around 88,000 of these class members have indicated\\nthat they received at least one breast implant manufactured by MEC or a\\nrelated company.  Of these 88,000 registrants, 14,300 have opted out of\\nthe revised settlement; 6,300 of these have proved to the satisfaction of\\nthe claims office that they received a breast implant of MEC or a related\\ncompany, while the remaining 8,000 opt-outs have indicated their belief\\n(but have not proved) that they received an MEC breast implant.  The\\n14,300 opt-outs who have or claim to have MEC implants are among the\\n44,800 domestic registrants (with implants of all manufacturers) who opted\\nout of the revised settlement.  The Company has identified approximately\\n10,800 persons from among the 44,800 opt-outs (with implants of all\\ndefendants, not just MEC) as plaintiffs in lawsuits against it.  An as yet\\nundetermined number of these 10,800 plaintiffs do not have MEC implants\\nand their claims against the Company are expected to be dismissed.  An\\nadditional 1,570 claims based upon MEC implants remain from among domestic\\nclass members who previously opted out of the settlement originally\\napproved in 1994.  Because the opt-out period is essentially over, the\\nnumber  of opt-outs in not expected to increase materially.  However,\\nbecause of continuing uncertainties, it is still not possible to predict\\non any precise basis the total number of women with MEC implants who will\\npursue lawsuits against the Company.\\n\\nThe cost of the settlement is dependent upon complex and varying factors,\\nincluding the number of class members that participate, the kinds of\\nclaims approved and their dollar value.

As\\nset forth in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, in 1995, 1996 and\\n1997, the Company paid substantial sums to settle litigation and opt-out\\nclaims and for litigation expenses, as well as to the revised settlement.\\n\\nIn connection with breast implant product liability claims, the Company\\nrecorded special charges in 1993 of $500 million before taxes, $310\\nmillion after taxes, or $.30 per common share, basic and diluted; in 1994\\nof $750 million before taxes, $488 million after taxes, or $.48 per common\\nshare, basic and diluted; and in 1995 of $950 million before taxes, $590\\nmillion after taxes, or $.58 per common share, basic and diluted.  The\\n1993 special charge consisted of $1.5 billion (recorded as Product\\nLiability), offset by $1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds\\n(recorded as Insurance Recoverable).\\n\\nIn light of the continuing uncertainties (including additional insurance\\nrecoveries), the cost of the revised settlement and the ongoing litigation\\ncannot at present be predicted with any reasonable degree of precision.\\nHowever, the Company, based on the information set forth above and on\\nrelated estimates, continues to believe that previously established\\nreserves should be adequate to address these claims.\\n\\nOther Actions\\n- -------------\\n\\nThe Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are or have been\\ndefendants in a number of antitrust actions in various states filed on\\nbehalf of purported statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant\\nformula products and by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and\\nMississippi, alleging a price fixing conspiracy and other violations of\\nstate antitrust or deceptive trade practice laws and seeking penalties and\\nother relief.  The Company has previously reported reaching settlements\\nand receiving final court approval in the majority of these cases.  The\\nonly open cases are in Louisiana and Missouri. On November 6, 1997, the\\ncourt in Louisiana dismissed the plaintiffs\\' case.  The plaintiffs are\\nappealing that dismissal.  In Missouri, the Company has a motion to\\ndismiss pending.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 1997, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions\\nbrought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical\\nmanufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various\\nfederal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains\\nand independent drugstores, suing either individually or as\\nrepresentatives of a nationwide class of retail pharmacies that has been\\ncertified.  These cases, which have been coordinated for pretrial\\npurposes, all seek treble damages and injunctive relief on account of\\nalleged antitrust violations in the pricing and marketing of brand name\\nprescription drugs.  The Company, without admitting any wrongdoing,\\nreached an amended agreement as of May 1, 1996, to settle the class\\naction, and that settlement has become final.

(i) The Company may,\\nby sending an Extension Letter to Citibank (in which case Citibank shall\\npromptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), during the period of not less\\nthan 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to any anniversary of the date\\nhereof, request that the Lenders extend the Maturity Date at the time in\\neffect to the first anniversary of such date.  Each Lender, acting in its\\nsole discretion, shall, by notice to Citibank given not more than 20 days\\nafter the date of the Extension Letter, advise Citibank in writing whether\\nor not such Lender agrees to such extension (each Lender that so advises\\nCitibank that it will not extend the Maturity Date, being referred to herein\\nas a \"Non-extending Lender\"); provided that any Lender that does not advise\\nCitibank by the 20th day after the date of the Extension Letter shall be\\ndeemed to be a Non-extending Lender.  The election of any Lender to agree\\nto such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to agree.\\n\\n          (ii) (A) If Lenders holding Commitments that aggregate at least\\n51% of the total Commitments on the 20th day after the date of the Extension\\nLetter shall not have agreed to extend the Maturity Date, then the Maturity\\nDate shall not be so extended and the outstanding principal balance of all\\nLoans and other amounts payable hereunder shall be payable on such Maturity\\nDate.  (B) If (and only if) Lenders holding Commitments that aggregate at\\nleast 51% of the total Commitments on the 20th day after the date of the\\nExtension Letter shall have agreed to extend the Maturity Date, then the\\nMaturity Date applicable to the Lenders that shall so have agreed, shall be\\nthe first anniversary of the current Maturity Date.  In the event of such\\nextension, the Commitment of each Non-extending Lender shall terminate on\\nthe Maturity Date in effect prior to such extension, all Loans and other\\namounts payable hereunder to such Non-extending Lenders shall become due\\nand payable on such Maturity Date and the total Commitment of the Lenders\\nhereunder shall be reduced by the Commitments of Non-extending Lenders so\\nterminated on such Maturity Date.\\n\\n          (iii)  In the event that the conditions of clause (B) of paragraph\\n(ii) above have been satisfied, the Company shall have the right on or before\\nthe Maturity Date in effect prior to the requested extension, at its own\\nexpense, to require any Non-extending Lender to transfer and assign without\\nrecourse (except as to title and the absence of Liens created by it) (in\\naccordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 8.4)\\nall its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more\\n\\n\\n                                E-1-23\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nbanks or other financial institutions identified to the Non-extending Lender,\\nwhich may include any Lender (each an \"Additional Commitment Lender\"),\\nprovided that (x) such Additional Commitment Lender, if not already a Lender\\nhereunder, shall be subject to the approval of Citibank and the Company (such\\napprovals not to be unreasonably withheld), (y) such assignment shall become\\neffective as of a date specified by the Company (which shall not be later\\nthan the Maturity Date in effect prior to the requested extension) and (z)\\nthe Additional Commitment Lender shall pay to such Non-extending Lender in\\nimmediately available funds on the effective date of such assignment the\\nprincipal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made\\nby it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it\\nhereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension of the Maturity Date\\nshall become effective unless, on the Maturity Date in effect prior to the\\nrequested extension the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of\\nSection 4.2 shall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs to a\\nBorrowing being deemed to be references to the current Maturity Date) and\\nCitibank shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such Maturity\\nDate and executed by a Financial Officer of the Company.\\n\\n          SECTION 2.6  Increase of Commitments.  (a)  The Company may, by\\nnotice to Citibank (in which case Citibank shall promptly deliver a copy to\\neach of the Lenders), request that the total Commitments be increased by an\\namount that will equal or exceed $20,000,000, but that will not result in the\\ntotal Commitments exceeding $500,000,000.  Each such notice shall set forth\\nthe amount of the requested increase in the total Commitments and the date on\\nwhich such increase is requested to become effective (which shall be not less\\nthan 20 days or more than 45 days after the date of such notice (or such\\nshorter time as may be agreed upon by the Company and Citibank)), and shall\\noffer each Lender the opportunity to increase its Commitment by its\\nApplicable Percentage of the proposed increased amount.  Each Lender shall,\\nby notice to the Company and Citibank given not more than 20 days after the\\ndate of the Company\\'s notice (or such shorter time as may be agreed upon by\\nthe Company and Citibank), either agree to increase its Commitment by all or\\na portion of the offered amount (each Lender so agreeing being an \"Increasing\\nLender\") or decline to increase its Commitment (and any Lender that does not\\ndeliver such a notice within such period of 20 days (or such shorter time as\\nmay be agreed upon by the Company and Citibank) shall be deemed to have\\ndeclined to increase its Commitment) (each Lender so declining or deemed to\\nhave declined being a \"Non-increasing Lender\").  In the event that, on the\\n20th day (or such shorter time as may be agreed upon by the Company and\\nCitibank) after the Company shall have delivered a notice pursuant to the\\nfirst sentence of this paragraph, the Lenders shall have agreed pursuant to\\nthe preceding sentence to increase their Commitments by an aggregate amount\\nless than the increase in the total Commitments requested by the Company,\\nCitibank or the Company may arrange for one or more banks or other\\nfinancial institutions (any such bank or other financial institution as\\nreferred to in this clause (a) being called an \"Augmenting Lender\"), which\\nmay include any Lender, to extend Commitments or increase their existing\\nCommitments in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount, provided\\nthat each Augmenting Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be\\nsubject to the approval of the Company and Citibank (which approvals shall\\nnot be unreasonably withheld) and each Augmenting Lender shall execute all\\nsuch documentation as Citibank shall reasonably specify to evidence its\\nCommitment and its status as a Lender hereunder.  Increases and new\\nCommitments created pursuant to this clause (a) shall become effective\\non the date specified in the notice delivered by the Company pursuant to\\nthe first sentence of this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no\\nincrease in the total Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender)\\nshall become effective under this paragraph unless, (i) on the date of\\nsuch increase, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section\\n4.2 shall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs to a\\nBorrowing being deemed to be references to such increase) and Citibank shall\\nhave received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a\\n\\n                                E-1-24\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nFinancial Officer of the Company and (ii) to the extent requested from the\\nCompany, Citibank shall have received (with sufficient copies for each of the\\nLenders) documents consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date\\nunder clauses (b) and (c) of Section 4.1 as to the corporate power and\\nauthority of the Company to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such\\nincrease.\\n\\n          (b)  On the effective date (the \"Increase Effective Date\") of any\\nincrease in the total Commitments pursuant to Section 2.6(a) (the \"Commitment\\nIncrease\"), (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding (the\\n\"Initial Loans\") immediately prior to giving effect to the Commitment\\nIncrease on the Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be paid, (ii) each\\nIncreasing Lender shall pay to Citibank in same day funds an amount equal to\\nthe difference between (A) the product of (1) such Increasing Lender\\'s\\nApplicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment\\nIncrease) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings (as\\nhereinafter defined) and (B) the product of (1) such Increasing Lender\\'s\\nApplicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment\\nIncrease) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Initial Loans, (iii) each\\nAugmenting Lender shall pay to Citibank in same day funds an amount equal\\nto the product of (1) such Augmenting Lender\\'s Applicable Percentage\\n(calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by\\n(2) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings, and (iv) after Citibank receives\\nthe funds specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, Citibank shall pay to\\neach Non-increasing Lender the portion of such funds that is equal to the\\ndifference between (A) the product of (1) such Non-increasing Lender\\'s\\nApplicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment\\nIncrease) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Initial Loans, and (B) the\\nproduct of (1) such Non-increasing Lender\\'s Applicable Percentage (calculated\\nafter giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount\\nof the Subsequent Borrowings, (v) after the effectiveness of the Commitment\\nIncrease, the Company shall be deemed to have made new Borrowings (the\\n\"Subsequent Borrowings\") in an aggregate principal amount equal to the\\naggregate principal amount of the Initial Loans and of the types and for\\nthe Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to Citibank\\nin accordance with Section 2.3, (vi) each Non-increasing Lender, each\\nIncreasing Lender and each Augmenting Lender shall be deemed to hold its\\nApplicable Percentage of each Subsequent Borrowing (calculated after giving\\neffect to the Commitment Increase) and (vii) the Company shall pay each\\nIncreasing Lender and each Non-increasing Lender any and all accrued but\\nunpaid interest on the Initial Loans.  The deemed payments made pursuant to\\nclause (i) above in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan shall be subject to\\nindemnification by the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16\\nif the Increase Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the\\nInterest Period relating thereto.  If requested by a Lender, the Company,\\nat its own expense, shall execute and deliver to Citibank on behalf of each\\nIncreasing Lender and each Augmenting Lender a promissory note complying\\nwith the provisions of Section 2.10(e) hereof, in a principal amount equal\\nto the Commitment of such Lender hereunder after giving effect to the\\nCommitment Increase.  Each Increasing Lender shall promptly surrender to\\nCitibank any previous promissory note held by it, for return to the Company\\nand shall indemnify the Company for any claims, losses, damages or expenses\\n(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) arising out of its\\nfailure to surrender such promissory note, provided the Company does not\\n(unless pursuant to a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction)\\nmake any payments in respect of such promissory note.\\n\\n          SECTION 2.7  Funding of Borrowings.  (a)  Each Lender shall make\\neach Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire\\ntransfer of immediately available funds in Dollars or in the applicable\\nAlternative Currency, as the case may be, to the account of Citibank or an\\nAffiliate thereof most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice\\n\\n\\n                                E-1-25\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nto the Lenders, by 2:00 p.m., New York City time (or, in the case of any\\nCompetitive Loan with respect to which a Borrower shall have requested\\nfunding in another jurisdiction, to such account in such jurisdiction as\\nCitibank shall designate for such purpose by notice to the applicable\\nLenders, by 2:00 p.m., local time).  Citibank will make such Loans available\\nto such Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like\\nfunds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with Citibank in New York\\nCity (or, in the case of any Competitive Loan with respect to which such\\nBorrower shall have requested funding in another jurisdiction, to such\\naccount in such jurisdiction as such Borrower shall have designated in the\\napplicable Competitive Bid Request).\\n\\n          (b)  Unless Citibank shall have received notice from a Lender\\nprior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make\\navailable to Citibank such Lender\\'s share of such Borrowing, Citibank may\\nassume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in\\naccordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon\\nsuch assumption, make available to such Borrower a corresponding amount.\\nIn such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable\\nBorrowing available to Citibank, then the applicable Lender and the\\napplicable Borrower severally agree to pay to Citibank forthwith on demand\\nsuch corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and\\nincluding the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but\\nexcluding the date of payment to Citibank, at (i) in the case of such Lender,\\nthe greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by\\nCitibank in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation\\nor (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate on the applicable\\nBorrowing; provided that no repayment by such Borrower pursuant to this\\nsentence shall be deemed to be a prepayment for purposes of Section 2.16.\\nIf such Lender pays such amount to Citibank, then such amount shall\\nconstitute such Lender\\'s Loan included in such Borrowing.\\n\\n          SECTION 2.8  Interest Elections.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of\\nDefault has occurred and is continuing and Citibank, at the request of the\\nRequired Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of\\nDefault is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted\\nto or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each\\nEurocurrency Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at\\nthe end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.\\n\\n          SECTION 2.9  Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any\\nBorrowing Subsidiary Obligation shall be due in a currency other than\\nDollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason\\nof any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war\\nor civil disturbance or similar event, payment of such Borrowing Subsidiary\\nObligation in such currency or such place of payment shall be impossible or,\\nin the judgment of any applicable Lender, not consistent with the protection\\nof its rights or interests, then, at the election of any applicable Lender,\\nthe Company shall make payment of such Borrowing Subsidiary Obligation in\\nDollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of\\npayment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify such Lender against any\\nlosses or expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative\\npayment.\\n\\n          Upon payment by the Company of any Borrowing Subsidiary Obligations,\\neach Lender shall, in a reasonable manner, assign the amount of the Borrowing\\nSubsidiary Obligations owed to it and paid by the Company pursuant to this\\nguarantee to the Company, such assignment to be pro tanto to the extent to\\nwhich the Borrowing Subsidiary Obligations in question were discharged by the\\nCompany, or make such disposition thereof as the Company shall direct (all\\nwithout recourse to any Lender and without any representation or warranty by\\nany Lender except with respect to the amount of the Borrowing Subsidiary\\nObligations so assigned).\\n\\n          Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all\\nrights of the Company against any Borrowing Subsidiary arising as a result\\nthereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be\\nsubordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment\\nin full of all the Borrowing Subsidiary Obligations to the Lenders.\\n\\n          SECTION 8.17  European Monetary Union.  If, as a result of the\\nimplementation of European monetary union, (a) any currency ceases to be\\nlawful currency of the nation issuing the same and is replaced by a European\\ncommon currency, then any amount payable hereunder by any party hereto in such\\ncurrency shall instead be payable in the European common currency and the\\namount so payable shall be determined by translating the amount payable in\\nsuch currency to such European common currency at the exchange rate recognized\\nby the European Central Bank for the purpose of implementing European monetary\\nunion, or (b) any currency and a European common currency are at the same time\\nrecognized by the central bank or comparable authority of the nation issuing\\nsuch currency as lawful currency of such nation, then (i) any Loan made at such\\ntime shall be made in such European common currency and (ii) any other amount\\npayable by any party hereto in such currency shall be payable in such currency\\nor in such European common currency (in an amount determined as set forth in\\n\\n\\n                                E-1-57\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclause (a)), at the election of the obligor.

The Borrowers agree, at the request of the Required Lenders,\\nat the time of or at any time following the implementation of European\\nmonetary union, to enter into an agreement amending this Agreement in such\\nmanner as the Required Lenders shall reasonably request in order to avoid any\\nunfair burden or disadvantage resulting from the implementation of such\\nmonetary union and to place the parties hereto in the position they would have\\nbeen in had such monetary union not been implemented, the intent being that\\nneither party will be adversely affected economically as a result of such\\nimplementation and that reasonable provisions shall be adopted to govern\\nthe borrowing, maintenance and repayment of Loans denominated in currencies\\nother than Dollars after the occurrence of the event or events described in\\nclause (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                E-1-58\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          IN WITNESS

Each Lender shall, by notice to the Company and\\nCitibank given not more than 20 days after the date of the Company\\'s notice (or\\nsuch shorter time as may be agreed upon by the Company and Citibank), either\\nagree to increase its Commitment by all or a portion of the offered amount (each\\nLender so agreeing being an \"Increasing Lender\") or decline to increase its\\nCommitment (and any Lender that does not deliver such a notice within such\\nperiod of 20 days (or such shorter time as may be agreed upon by the Company and\\nCitibank) shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment) (each\\nLender so declining or deemed to have declined being a \"Non-increasing Lender\").\\nIn the event that, on the 20th day (or such shorter time as may be agreed upon\\nby the Company and Citibank) after the Company shall have delivered a notice\\n\\n                             E-2-24\\n<PAGE>\\n\\npursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph, the Lenders shall have agreed\\npursuant to the preceding sentence to increase their Commitments by an aggregate\\namount less than the increase in the total Commitments requested by the Company,\\nCitibank or the Company may arrange for one or more banks or other financial\\ninstitutions (any such bank or other financial institution as referred to in\\nthis clause (a)being called an \"Augmenting Lender\"), which may include any\\nLender, to extend Commitments or increase their existing Commitments in an\\naggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount, provided that each Augmenting\\nLender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of\\nthe Company and Citibank (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld)\\nand each Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as Citibank\\nshall reasonably specify to evidence its Commitment and its status as a Lender\\nhereunder.  Increases and new Commitments created pursuant to this clause\\n(a) shall become effective on the date specified in the notice delivered by the\\nCompany pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph.   Notwithstanding the\\nforegoing, no increase in the total Commitments (or in the Commitment of any\\nLender) shall become effective under this paragraph unless, (i) on the date of\\nsuch increase, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)and (b) of Section 4.2\\nshall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs to a Borrowing being\\ndeemed to be references to such increase) and Citibank shall have received a\\ncertificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer\\nof the Company and (ii) to the extent requested from the Company, Citibank shall\\nhave received (with sufficient copies for each of the Lenders) documents\\nconsistent with those delivered on the Effective Date under clauses (b) and (c)\\nof Section 4.1 as to the corporate power and authority of the Company to borrow\\nhereunder after giving effect to such increase.\\n\\n          (b)  On the effective date (the \"Increase Effective Date\") of any\\nincrease in the total Commitments pursuant to Section 2.6(a) (the \"Commitment\\nIncrease\"), (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding (the\\n\"Initial Loans\") immediately prior to giving effect to the Commitment Increase\\non the Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be paid, (ii) each Increasing\\nLender shall pay to Citibank in same day funds an amount equal to the difference\\nbetween (A) the product of (1) such Increasing Lender\\'s Applicable Percentage\\n(calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2)\\nthe amount of the Subsequent Borrowings (as hereinafter defined) and (B) the\\nproduct of (1) such Increasing Lender\\'s Applicable Percentage (calculated\\nwithout giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount\\nof the Initial Loans, (iii) each Augmenting Lender shall pay to Citibank in same\\nday funds an amount equal to the product of (1) such Augmenting Lender\\'s\\nApplicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment\\nIncrease) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings, and (iv)\\nafter Citibank receives the funds specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) above,\\nCitibank shall pay to each Non-increasing Lender the portion of such funds that\\nis equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Non-increasing\\nLender\\'s Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the\\nCommitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Initial Loans, and (B)\\nthe product of (1) such Non-increasing Lender\\'s Applicable Percentage\\n(calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2)\\nthe amount of the Subsequent Borrowings, (v) after the effectiveness of the\\nCommitment Increase, the Company shall be deemed to have made new Borrowings\\n(the \"Subsequent Borrowings\") in an aggregate principal amount equal to the\\naggregate principal amount of the Initial Loans and of the types and for the\\nInterest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to Citibank in\\naccordance with Section 2.3, (vi) each Non-increasing Lender, each Increasing\\n\\n                             E-2-25\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nLender and each Augmenting Lender shall be deemed to hold its Applicable\\nPercentage of each Subsequent Borrowing (calculated after giving effect to the\\nCommitment Increase) and (vii) the Company shall pay each Increasing Lender and\\neach Non-increasing Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on the\\nInitial Loans.  The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (i) above in respect\\nof each Eurocurrency Loan shall be subject to indemnification by the Company\\npursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the Increase Effective Date occurs\\nother than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto.

Each Increasing Lender shall\\npromptly surrender to Citibank any previous promissory note held by it, for\\nreturn to the Company and shall indemnify the Company for any claims, losses,\\ndamages or expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel)\\narising out of its failure to surrender such promissory note, provided the\\nCompany does not (unless pursuant to a final judgment of a court of competent\\njurisdiction) make any payments in respect of such promissory note.\\n\\n          SECTION 2.7  Funding of Borrowings.

In such event, if a Lender has not in\\nfact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Citibank, then the\\napplicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to Citibank\\nforthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each\\nday from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower\\nto but excluding the date of payment to Citibank, at (i) in the case of such\\nLender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by\\nCitibank in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or\\n(ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate on the applicable\\nBorrowing; provided that no repayment by such Borrower pursuant to this sentence\\nshall be deemed to be a prepayment for purposes of Section 2.16. If such Lender\\npays such amount to Citibank, then such amount shall constitute such Lender\\'s\\nLoan included in such Borrowing.\\n\\n                             E-2-26\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n          SECTION 2.8  Interest Elections.  (a) Each Revolving Borrowing\\ninitially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request\\nand, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial\\nInterest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.

(a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it\\nhereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, or of amounts payable under\\nSection 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 3:00 p.m., local time at the\\nplace of payment, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without\\nset-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may,\\nin the discretion of Citibank, be deemed to have been received on the next\\nsucceeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such\\npayments shall be made to Citibank at its offices at 399 Park Avenue, New York,\\nNew York, or such other location as Citibank shall designate from time to time,\\nexcept that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 8.5 shall be made\\ndirectly to the Persons entitled thereto.

If any payment hereunder shall be\\ndue on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended\\nto the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing\\ninterest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.\\nAll payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars or, in the case of Competitive\\nLoans, the applicable Currency, as the case may be.\\n\\n                             E-2-36\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to\\nCitibank to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due\\nhereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest\\nand fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in\\naccordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and\\n(ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the\\nparties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to\\nsuch parties.\\n\\n          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or\\ncounterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or\\ninterest on any of its Revolving Loans resulting in such Lender receiving\\npayment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans\\nand accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender,\\nthen the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at\\nface value) participations in the Revolving Loans of other Lenders to the extent\\nnecessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the\\nLenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and\\naccrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans; provided that (i) if any\\nsuch participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving\\nrise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the\\npurchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and\\n(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any\\npayment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express\\nterms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for\\nthe assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee\\nor participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof\\n(as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  Each Borrower\\nconsents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so\\nunder applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the\\nforegoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and\\ncounterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were\\na direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.\\n\\n          (d) Unless Citibank shall have received notice from a Borrower prior\\nto the date on which any payment is due to Citibank for the account of the\\nLenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, Citibank may\\nassume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance\\nherewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders\\nthe amount due.  In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such\\npayment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to Citibank\\nforthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest\\nthereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to\\nit to but excluding the date of payment to Citibank, at the greater of the\\nFederal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by Citibank in accordance\\nwith banking industry rules on interbank compensation.\\n\\n          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made\\nby it pursuant to Section 2.7(b) or 2.18(d), then Citibank may, in its\\ndiscretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts\\nthereafter received by Citibank for the account of such Lender to satisfy such\\nLender\\'s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations\\nare fully paid.\\n\\n                             E-2-37\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n          SECTION 2.19  Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a) If\\nany Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is\\nrequired to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental\\nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such\\nLender shall use reasonable efforts to file any certificate or document\\nrequested by the Company (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions), to\\ndesignate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder\\nor to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices,\\nbranches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such filing,\\ndesignation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant\\nto Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not\\notherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.\\n\\n          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any\\nBorrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any\\nGovernmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,\\nor if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then such\\nBorrower may, upon notice to such Lender and Citibank, require such Lender to\\nassign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the\\nrestrictions contained in Section 8.4), all its interests, rights and\\nobligations under this Agreement (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans\\nheld by it and any and all rights and interests related thereto) to an assignee\\nthat shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a\\nLender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) such Borrower shall have\\nreceived the prior written consent of the Administrative Agents which consent\\nshall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment\\nof an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than\\nCompetitive Loans), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts\\npayable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding\\nprincipal and accrued interest and fees) or such Borrower (in the case of all\\nother amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a\\nclaim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made\\npursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such\\ncompensation or payments.\\n\\n          SECTION 2.20  Borrowing Subsidiaries.  The Company may designate any\\nWholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company as a Borrowing Subsidiary.  Upon the\\nreceipt by Citibank of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such a\\nWholly Owned Subsidiary and the Company, such Wholly Owned Subsidiary shall be a\\nBorrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement.  A Subsidiary shall cease to\\nbe a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder at such time as no Loans, fees or any other\\namounts due in connection therewith pursuant to the terms hereof shall be\\noutstanding to such Subsidiary and such Subsidiary and the Company shall have\\nexecuted and delivered to Citibank a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination; provided\\nthat, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Borrowing Subsidiary\\nshall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary solely because it no longer is a\\nWholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company so long as such Borrowing Subsidiary and\\nthe Company shall not have executed and delivered to Citibank a Borrowing\\nSubsidiary Termination and the Company\\'s guarantee of the Borrowing Subsidiary\\nObligations of such Borrowing Subsidiary pursuant to Section 8.16 has not been\\nreleased.\\n\\n                             E-2-38\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n                              ARTICLE III\\n\\n                    Representations and Warranties\\n\\n          The Company represents and warrants to each of the Lenders and each of\\nthe Administrative Agents that:\\n\\n          SECTION 3.1  Organization; Powers.

The Committee shall (1) select the officers and\\nkey employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom\\noptions may from time to time be granted, (2) determine whether incentive stock\\noptions or nonqualified stock options are to be granted, (3) determine the\\nnumber of shares to be covered by each option so granted, (4) determine the\\nterms and conditions (not inconsistent with the Plan) of any option granted\\nhereunder (including but not limited to restrictions upon the options,\\nconditions of their exercise, or on the shares of Common Stock issuable upon\\nexercise thereof), (5) determine whether nonqualified stock options or\\nincentive stock options granted under the Plan shall include stock appreciation\\nrights and, if so, shall determine the terms and conditions thereof in\\naccordance with Section 6(b)(11) hereof, (6) determine whether any nonqualified\\nstock options granted under the Plan shall be Associated Options, and (7)\\nprescribe the form of the instruments necessary or advisable in the\\nadministration of options.\\n\\n          (b) Terms and Conditions of Option. Any option granted under the Plan\\nshall be evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement executed by the Company and the\\noptionee, in such form as the Committee shall approve, which agreement shall be\\nsubject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional\\nterms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan, and in the case of an\\nincentive stock option not inconsistent with the provisions of the Code\\napplicable to incentive stock options, as the Committee shall prescribe:\\n\\n               (1) Number of Shares Subject to an Option. The Stock Option\\nAgreement shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the\\nAgreement. If the option is an Associated Option, the number of shares of\\nCommon Stock subject to such Associated Option shall initially be equal to the\\nnumber of performance units or performance shares subject to the award, but one\\nshare of Common Stock shall be canceled for each performance unit or\\nperformance share paid out under the award.\\n\\n               (2) Option Price. The purchase price per share of Common Stock\\npurchasable under an option will be determined by the Committee but will be not\\nless than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of the\\ngrant of such option.\\n\\n               (3) Option Period. The period of each option shall be fixed by\\nthe Committee, but no option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten\\nyears from the date the option is granted.\\n\\n               (4) Consideration. Each optionee, as consideration for the grant\\nof an option, shall remain in the continuous employ of the Company or of one of\\nits Subsidiaries or Affiliates for at least one year from the date of the\\ngranting of such option, and no option shall be exercisable until after the\\ncompletion of such one year period of employment by the optionee.\\n\\n               (5) Exercise of Option. An option may be exercised in whole or\\nin part from time to time during the option period (or, if determined by the\\nCommittee, in specified installments during the option period) by giving\\nwritten notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of shares to be\\npurchased, such notice to be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase\\nprice and Withholding Taxes (as defined in Section 11 hereof), unless an\\nelection to defer receipt of shares is made under Section 12, due either by\\n\\n                                    E-3-3\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\ncertified or bank check, or in shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by\\nthe optionee having a Fair Market Value at the date of exercise equal to such\\npurchase price, or in a combination of the foregoing; provided, however, that\\npayment in shares of Common Stock of the Company will not be permitted unless\\nat least 100 shares of Common Stock are required and delivered for such\\npurpose. No shares shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made.\\nAn optionee shall have the rights of a stockholder only with respect to shares\\nof stock for which certificates have been issued to the optionee.\\n\\n               (6) Nontransferability of Options. No option or stock\\nappreciation right granted under the Plan shall be transferable by the optionee\\notherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and such\\noption or stock appreciation right shall be exercisable, during the optionee\\'s\\nlifetime, only by the optionee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee\\nmay set forth in a Stock Option Agreement at the time of grant or thereafter,\\nthat the options (other than Incentive Stock Options) may be transferred to\\nmembers of the optionee\\'s immediate family, to trusts solely for the benefit of\\nsuch immediate family members and to partnerships in which such family members\\nand/or trusts are the only partners. For this purpose, immediate family means\\nthe optionee\\'s spouse, parents, children, stepchildren, grandchildren and legal\\ndependants. Any transfer of options made under this provision will not be\\neffective until notice of such transfer is delivered to the Company.\\n\\n               (7) Retirement and Termination of Employment Other than by Death\\nor Disability. If an optionee shall cease to be employed by the Company or any\\nof its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any reason (other than termination of\\nemployment by reason of death or Disability) after the optionee shall have been\\ncontinuously so employed for one year after the granting of the option, the\\noption shall be exercisable only to the extent that the optionee was otherwise\\nentitled to exercise it at the time of such cessation of employment with the\\nCompany, Subsidiary or Affiliate, but in no event after the expiration of the\\noption period set forth therein except that in the case of cessation of\\nemployment other than by reason of Retirement or death, the option shall in no\\nevent be exercisable after the date three months next succeeding such cessation\\nof employment.

Deferrals will only be allowed for exercises which occur while the\\noptionee or participant is an active employee of the Company. Any election to\\ndefer the delivery of proceeds from an eligible award shall be irrevocable as\\nlong as the optionee or participant remains an employee of the Company.\\n\\n          (b) Stock Option Deferral: The deferral of the proceeds of stock\\noptions may be elected by an optionee subject to the Regulations established by\\nthe Committee. The proceeds from such an exercise shall be credited to the\\noptionee\\'s deferred stock option account as the number of deferred share units\\nequivalent in value to those proceeds. Deferred share units shall be valued at\\nthe Fair Market Value on the date of exercise. Subsequent to exercise, the\\ndeferred share units shall be valued at the Fair Market Value of Common Stock\\nof the Company. Deferred share units shall accrue dividends at the rate paid\\nupon the Company\\'s Common Stock credited in the form of additional deferred\\nshare units. Deferred share units shall be distributed in shares of Company\\nStock upon the termination of employment of the participant or at such other\\ndate as may be approved by the Committee over a period of no more than 10\\nyears.\\n\\n          (c) Stock Appreciation Right Deferral: Upon such exercise, the\\nCompany will credit the optionee\\'s deferred stock option account with the\\nnumber of deferred share units equivalent in value to the difference between\\nthe Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the exercise date and the\\nexercise price of the Stock Appreciation Right multiplied by the number of\\nshares exercised. Deferred share units shall be valued at the Fair Market Value\\non the date of exercise.  Subsequent to exercise, the deferred share units\\nshall be valued at the Fair Market Value of Common Stock of the Company.\\nDeferred share units shall accrue dividends at the rate paid upon the\\nCompany\\'s Common Stock credited in the form of additional deferred share units.\\nDeferred share units shall be distributed in shares of Common Stock upon the\\ntermination of employment of the participant or at such other date as may be\\napproved by the Committee over a period of no more than 10 years.\\n\\n          (d) Accelerated Distributions: The Committee may, at its sole\\ndiscretion, allow for the early payment of an optionee\\'s or participant\\'s\\ndeferred share units account in the event of an \"unforeseeable emergency\" or in\\nthe event of the death or disability of the optionee or participant. An\\n\"unforeseeable emergency\" is defined as an unanticipated emergency caused by an\\nevent beyond the control of the optionee or participant that would result in\\nsevere financial hardship if the distribution were not permitted. Such\\ndistributions shall be limited to the amount necessary to sufficiently address\\nthe financial hardship. Any distributions under this provision shall be\\nconsistent with the Regulations established under the Code. Additionally, the\\nCommittee may use its discretion to cause deferred share unit accounts to be\\ndistributed when continuing the Program is no longer in the best interest of\\nthe Company.\\n\\n          (e) Assignability: No rights to deferred share unit accounts may be\\nassigned or subject to any encumbrance, pledge or charge of any nature except\\nthat an optionee or participant may designate a beneficiary pursuant to any\\nrules established by the Committee.\\n\\n     13.

An optionee shall have the rights of a stockholder\\nonly with respect to shares of stock for which certificates have been issued\\nto the optionee.\\n\\n         (6)  Nontransferability of Options.  No option or stock appreciation\\nright granted under the Plan shall be transferable by the optionee otherwise\\nthan by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and such option or\\nstock appreciation right shall be exercisable, during the optionee\\'s lifetime,\\nonly by the optionee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may set\\nforth in a Stock Option Agreement at the time of grant or thereafter, that the\\noptions may be transferred to members of the optionee\\'s immediate family, to\\ntrusts solely for the benefit of such immediate family members and to\\npartnerships in which such family members and/or trusts are the only partners.\\nFor this purpose, immediate family members means the optionee\\'s spouse,\\nparents, children, stepchildren, grandchildren and legal dependents.  Any\\ntransfer of options made under this provision will not be effective until\\nnotice of such transfer is delivered to the Company.\\n\\n         (7)  Retirement and Termination of Employment Other than by Death or\\nDisability.  If an optionee shall cease to be employed by the Company or any\\nof its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any reason (other than termination of\\nemployment by reason of death or Disability) after the optionee shall have\\nbeen continuously so employed for one year after the granting of the option,\\nthe option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the optionee was\\notherwise entitled to exercise it at the time of such cessation of employment\\nwith the Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate, but in no event after the\\nexpiration of the option period set forth therein except that in the case of\\ncessation of employment other than by reason of Retirement or death, the option\\nshall in no event be exercisable after the date three months next succeeding\\nsuch cessation of employment.  The Plan does not confer upon any optionee any\\nright with respect to continuation of employment by the Company or any of its\\nSubsidiaries or Affiliates.\\n\\n         (8)  Disability of Optionee.  An optionee who ceases to be employed\\nby reason of Disability shall be treated as though the optionee remained in\\nthe employ of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate until the earlier of\\n(i) cessation of payments under a disability pay plan of the Company,\\nSubsidiary or Affiliate, (ii) the optionee\\'s death, or (iii) the optionee\\'s\\n65th birthday.\\n\\n         (9)  Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of the optionee\\nwhile in the employ of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates\\nor within whichever period after Retirement or cessation of employment of the\\noptionee specified in subsection (7) or (8) is applicable, and provided the\\noptionee shall have been continuously so employed for one year after the\\ngranting of the option, the option shall be exercisable by the executors,\\nadministrators, legatees or distributees of the optionee\\'s estate, as the case\\nmay be, at any time following death but in no event after the expiration of\\nthe option period set forth therein and only to the extent that the optionee\\nwould otherwise have been entitled to exercise it if the optionee were then\\nliving, except that in the case of the death of an optionee after Retirement\\nor other cessation of employment, the option shall in no event be exercisable\\nafter the later of (i) the date twelve months next succeeding such death or\\n(ii) the last day of the period after Retirement or other cessation of\\nemployment of the optionee specified in Section 6(b)(7).  In the event any\\noption is exercised by the executors, administrators, legatees or distributees\\nof the estate of a deceased optionee, the Company shall be under no obligation\\nto issue stock thereunder unless and until the Company is satisfied that the\\nperson or persons exercising the option are the duly appointed legal\\nrepresentatives of the deceased optionee\\'s estate or the proper legatees or\\ndistributees thereof.\\n\\n                                E-4-4\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\n         (10) Long Term Performance Awards.  The Committee may from time to\\ntime grant nonqualified stock options under the Plan in conjunction with and\\nrelated to an award of performance units made under a Long Term Performance\\nAward as set forth in Section 7(b)(11).  In such event, notwithstanding any\\nother provision hereof, (i) the number of shares to which the Associated\\nOption applies shall initially be equal to the number of performance units\\ngranted by the award, but such number of shares shall be reduced on a one\\nshare-for-one unit basis to the extent that the Committee determines pursuant\\nto the terms of the award, to pay to the optionee or the optionee\\'s\\nbeneficiary the performance units granted pursuant to such award; and\\n(ii) such Associated Option shall be cancelable in the discretion of the\\nCommittee, without the consent of the optionee, under the conditions and to\\nthe extent specified in the award.\\n\\n         (11) Stock Appreciation Rights.  In the case of any option granted\\nunder the Plan, either at the time of grant or by amendment of such option at\\nany time after such grant there may be included a stock appreciation right\\nwhich shall be subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the\\nPlan, as the Committee shall impose, including the following:\\n\\n              (A)  A stock appreciation right shall be exercisable to the\\nextent, and only to the extent, that the option in which it is included is at\\nthe time exercisable, and may be exercised within such period only at such\\ntime or times as may be determined by the Committee;\\n\\n              (B)  A stock appreciation right shall entitle the optionee (or\\nany person entitled to act under the provisions of subsection (9) hereof) to\\nsurrender unexercised the option in which the stock appreciation right is\\nincluded (or any portion of such option) to the Company and to receive from\\nthe Company in exchange therefor that number of shares having an aggregate\\nvalue equal to (or, in the discretion of the Committee, less than) the excess\\nof the value of one share (provided such value does not exceed such multiple\\nof the option price per share as may be specified by the Committee) over the\\noption price per share specified in such option times the number of shares\\ncalled for by the option, or portion thereof, which is so surrendered.  The\\nCommittee shall be entitled to cause the Company to settle its obligation,\\narising out of the exercise of a stock appreciation right, by the payment of\\ncash equal to the aggregate value of the shares the Company would otherwise be\\nobligated to deliver or partly by the payment of cash and partly by the\\ndelivery of shares.  Any such election shall be made within 30 business days\\nafter the receipt by the Committee of written notice of the exercise of the\\nstock appreciation right.  The value of a share for this purpose shall be the\\nFair Market Value thereof on the last business day preceding the date of the\\nelection to exercise the stock appreciation right;\\n\\n              (C)  No fractional shares shall be delivered under this\\nsubsection (11) but in lieu thereof a cash adjustment shall be made;\\n\\n              (D)  If a stock appreciation right included in an option is\\nexercised, such option shall be deemed to have been exercised to the extent\\nof the number of shares called for by the option or portion thereof which is\\nsurrendered on exercise of the stock appreciation right and no new option may\\nbe granted covering such shares under this Plan; and\\n\\n              (E)  If an option which includes a stock appreciation right is\\nexercised, such stock appreciation right shall be deemed to have been canceled\\nto the extent of the number of shares called for by the option or portion\\nthereof is exercised and no new stock appreciation rights may be granted\\ncovering such shares under this Plan.\\n\\n                                E-4-5\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\n         (12) Incentive Stock Options.  In the case of any incentive stock\\noption granted under the Plan, the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares\\nof Common Stock of the Company (determined at the time of grant of each\\noption) with respect to which incentive stock options granted under the Plan\\nand any other plan of the Company or its parent or a Subsidiary which are\\nexercisable for the first time by an employee during any calendar year shall\\nnot exceed $100,000 or such other amount as may be required by the Code.  In\\nany year, the maximum number of shares with respect to which incentive stock\\noptions may be granted shall not exceed 4,000,000 shares.\\n\\n         (13) Rights of Transferee.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary\\nherein, if an option has been transferred in accordance with Section 6(b)(6),\\nthe option shall be exercisable solely by the transferee.  The option shall\\nremain subject to the provisions of the Plan, including that it will be\\nexercisable only to the extent that the optionee or optionee\\'s estate would\\nhave been entitled to exercise it if the optionee had not transferred the\\noption.  In the event of the death of the optionee prior to the expiration of\\nthe right to exercise the transferred option, the period during which the\\noption shall be exercisable will terminate on the date one year following the\\ndate of the optionee\\'s death.  In the event of the death of the transferee\\nprior to the expiration of the right to exercise the option, the period during\\nwhich the option shall be exercisable by the executors, administrators,\\nlegatees and distributees of the transferee\\'s estate, as the case may be, will\\nterminate on the date one year following the date of the transferee\\'s death.\\nIn no event will the option be exercisable after the expiration of the option\\nperiod set forth in the Stock Option Agreement.  The option shall be subject\\nto such other rules as the Committee shall determine.\\n\\n  7.     Long-term Performance Awards:  Awards under the Plan shall consist of\\nthe conditional grant to the participants of a specified number of\\nperformance units.  The conditional grant of a performance unit to a\\nparticipant will entitle the participant to receive a specified dollar value,\\nvariable under conditions specified in the award, if the performance objectives\\nspecified in the award are achieved and the other terms and conditions thereof\\nare satisfied.\\n\\n  Each award will be subject to the following terms and conditions:\\n\\n    (a)  Grant of Awards.  The Committee shall (1) select the officers and key\\nexecutives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom awards\\nmay from time to time be granted, (2) determine the number of performance\\nunits covered by each award, (3) determine the terms and conditions of each\\nperformance unit awarded and the award period and performance objectives with\\nrespect to each award, (4) determine the periods during which a participant\\nmay request the Committee to approve deferred payment of a percentage (50% or\\n100%) of an award (the \"Deferred Portion\") and the interest or rate of return\\nthereon or the basis on which such interest or rate of return thereon is to\\nbe determined, (5) determine whether payment with respect to the portion of an\\naward which has not been deferred (the \"Current Portion\") and the payment with\\nrespect to the Deferred Portion of an award shall be made entirely in cash,\\nentirely in Common Stock or partially in cash and partially in Common Stock,\\n(6) determine whether the award is to be made independently of or in\\nconjunction with a nonqualified stock option granted under the Plan, and (7)\\nprescribe the form of the instruments necessary or advisable in the\\nadministration of the awards.\\n\\n\\n\\n    (b)  Terms and Conditions of Award.  Any award conditionally granting\\nperformance units to a participant shall be evidenced by a Performance Unit\\nAgreement executed by the Company and the participant, in such form as the\\nCommittee shall approve, which Agreement shall contain in substance the\\nfollowing terms and conditions and such additional terms and conditions as the\\nCommittee shall prescribe:\\n\\n         (1)  Number of Performance Units.  The Performance Unit Agreement\\nshall specify the number of performance units conditionally granted to the\\nparticipant.  If the award has been made in conjunction with the grant of an\\nAssociated Option, the number of performance units granted shall initially be\\nequal to the number of shares which the participant is granted the right to\\npurchase pursuant to the Associated Option, but one performance unit shall be\\ncanceled for each share of the Company\\'s Common Stock purchased upon exercise\\nof the Associated Option or for each stock appreciation right included in such\\noption that has been exercised.\\n\\n                                E-4-6\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\n         (2)   Value of Performance Units.  The Performance Unit Agreement\\nshall specify the threshold, target and maximum dollar values of each\\nperformance unit and corresponding performance objectives as provided under\\nSection 7(b)(5).\\n\\n         (3)   Award Periods.  For each award, the Committee shall designate\\nan award period with a duration to be determined by the Committee in its\\ndiscretion but in no event less than three calendar years within which\\nspecified performance objectives are to be attained.  There may be several\\naward periods in existence at any one time and the duration of performance\\nobjectives may differ from each other.\\n\\n         (4)  Consideration.  Each participant, as consideration for the award\\nof performance units, shall remain in the continuous employ of the Company or\\nof one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for at least one year after the date\\nof the making of such award, and no award shall be payable until after the\\ncompletion of such one year of employment by the participant.\\n\\n         (5)  Performance Objectives.  The Committee shall establish\\nperformance objectives with respect to the Company for each award period on the\\nbasis of such criteria and to accomplish such objectives as the Committee may\\nfrom time to time determine.  Performance objectives may include objective and\\nsubjective criteria.  During any award period, the Committee may adjust the\\nperformance objectives for such award period as it deems equitable in\\nrecognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company, changes\\nin applicable tax laws or accounting principles, or such other factors as the\\nCommittee may determine.\\n\\n         (6)  Determination and Payment of Performance Units Earned.  As soon\\nas practicable after the end of an award period, the Committee shall determine\\nthe extent to which awards have been earned on the basis of the Company\\'s\\nactual performance in relation to the established performance objectives as\\nset forth in the Performance Unit Agreement.  The Performance Unit Agreement\\nshall specify that as soon as practicable after the end of each award period,\\nthe Committee shall determine whether the conditions of Sections 7(b)(4) and\\n7(b)(5) hereof have been met and, if so, shall ascertain the amount payable to\\nthe participant in respect of the performance units.  As promptly as\\npracticable after it has determined that an amount is payable in respect of an\\naward, the Committee shall cause the Current Portion of such award to be paid\\nto the participant or the participant\\'s beneficiaries, as the case may be, in\\nthe Committee\\'s discretion, either entirely in cash, entirely in Common Stock\\nor partially in cash and partially in Common Stock.  The Deferred Portion of\\nan award shall be contingently credited and payable to the participant over a\\ndeferred period and shall be credited with interest or a rate of return, as\\ndetermined by the Committee.  The Committee, in its discretion, shall\\ndetermine the conditions upon, and method of, payment of such deferred\\nportions and whether such payment will be made entirely in cash, entirely in\\nCommon Stock or partially in cash and partially in Common Stock.\\n\\n         In making the payment of an award in Common Stock hereunder, the cash\\nequivalent of such Common Stock shall be determined by the Fair Market Value\\nof the Common Stock on the day the Committee designates the performance units\\nshall be paid.\\n\\n         (7)  Nontransferability of Awards and Designation of Beneficiaries.\\nNo award under the Plan shall be transferable by the participant other than by\\nwill or by the laws of descent and distribution, except that a participant may\\ndesignate a beneficiary pursuant to the provisions hereof.\\n\\n         If any participant or the participant\\'s beneficiary shall attempt to\\nassign the participant\\'s rights under the Plan in violation of the provisions\\nthereof, the Company\\'s obligation to make any further payments to such\\nparticipant or the participant\\'s beneficiaries shall forthwith terminate.\\n\\n                                E-4-7\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n         A participant may name one or more beneficiaries to receive any\\npayment of an award to which the participant may be entitled under the Plan in\\nthe event of the participant\\'s death, on a form to be provided by the\\nCommittee.  A participant may change the participant\\'s beneficiary designation\\nfrom time to time in the same manner.\\n\\n         If no designated beneficiary is living on the date on which any\\npayment becomes payable to a participant\\'s beneficiary, such payment will be\\npayable to the person or persons in the first of the following classes of\\nsuccessive preference:\\n\\n         (I)       Widow or widower, if then living,\\n         (ii)      Surviving children, equally,\\n         (iii)     Surviving parents, equally,\\n         (iv)      Surviving brothers and sisters, equally,\\n         (v)       Executors or administrators\\n\\n    and the term \"beneficiary\" as used in the Plan shall include such person\\nor persons.\\n\\n         (8)  Retirement and Termination of Employment Other Than by Death or\\nDisability.  In the event of the Retirement prior to the end of an award\\nperiod of a participant who has satisfied the one year employment requirement\\nof Section 7(b)(4) with respect to an award prior to Retirement, the\\nparticipant, or his estate, shall be entitled to a payment of such award at\\nthe end of the award period, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the\\nparticipant\\'s Performance Unit Agreement, provided, however, that the\\nparticipant shall be deemed to have earned that proportion (to the nearest\\nwhole unit) of the value of the performance units granted to the participant\\nunder such award as the number of months of the award period which have elapsed\\nsince the first day of the calendar year in which the award was made to the\\nend of the month in which the participant\\'s Retirement occurs, bears to the\\ntotal number of months in the award period.  The participant\\'s rights in any\\nremaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.\\n\\n         Subject to Section 7(b)(6) hereof, the Performance Unit Agreement\\nshall specify that the rights of the participant in the performance units\\ngranted to such participant shall be conditional and shall be canceled,\\nforfeited and surrendered if the participant\\'s continuous employment with the\\nCompany and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall terminate for any reason,\\nother than the participant\\'s death, Disability or Retirement prior to the end\\nof the award period.\\n\\n         The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part, the\\ncancellation, forfeiture and surrender of any performance units.\\n\\n         (9)  Disability of Participant.  For the purposes of any award a\\nparticipant who becomes Disabled shall be deemed to have suspended active\\nemployment by reason of Disability commencing on the date the participant\\nbecomes entitled to receive payments under a disability pay plan of the\\nCompany or any Subsidiary or Affiliate and continuing until the date the\\nparticipant is no longer entitled to receive such payments.  In the event a\\nparticipant becomes Disabled during an award period but only if the\\nparticipant has satisfied the one year employment requirement of Section\\n7(b)(4) with respect to an award prior to becoming Disabled, upon the\\ndetermination by the Committee of the extent to which an award has been earned\\npursuant to Section 7(b)(6) the participant shall be deemed to have earned\\nthat proportion (to the nearest whole unit) of the value of the performance\\nunits granted to the participants under such award as the number of months of\\nthe award period in which the participant was not Disabled bears to the total\\nnumber of months of the award period.  The participant\\'s rights in any\\nremaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.\\n\\n         The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part,\\nsuch cancellation and forfeiture of any performance units.\\n\\n                                E-4-8\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\n         (10) Death of Participant.  In the event of the death prior to the\\nend of an award period of a participant who has satisfied the one year\\nemployment requirement with respect to an award prior to the date of death,\\nthe participant\\'s beneficiaries or estate, as the case may be, shall be\\nentitled to a payment of such award upon the end of the award period, pursuant\\nto the terms of the Plan and the participant\\'s Performance Unit Agreement,\\nprovided, however, that the participant shall be deemed to have earned that\\nproportion (to the nearest whole unit) of the value of the performance units\\ngranted to the participant under such award as the number of months of the\\naward period which have elapsed since the first day of the calendar year in\\nwhich the award was made to the end of the month in which the participant\\'s\\ndeath occurs, bears to the total number of months in the award period.  The\\nparticipant\\'s rights in any remaining performance units shall be canceled and\\nforfeited.\\n\\n         The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part,\\nsuch cancellation and forfeiture of any performance units.\\n\\n         (11) Grant of Associated Option.  If the Committee determines that\\nthe conditional grant of performance units under the Plan is to be made to a\\nparticipant in conjunction with the grant of a nonqualified stock option under\\nthe Plan, the Committee shall grant the participant an Associated Option under\\nthe Plan subject to the terms and conditions of this subsection (11).  In such\\nevent, such award under the Plan shall be contingent upon the participant\\'s\\nbeing granted such an Associated Option pursuant to which:  (i) the number of\\nshares the optionee may purchase shall initially be equal to the number of\\nperformance units conditionally granted by the award, (ii) such number of\\nshares shall be reduced on a one share-for-one unit basis to the extent that\\nthe Committee determines, pursuant to Section 7(b)(6) hereof, to pay to the\\nparticipant or the participant\\'s beneficiaries the performance units\\nconditionally granted pursuant to the award, and (iii) the Associated Option\\nshall be cancelable in the discretion of the Committee, without the consent of\\nthe participant, under the conditions and to the extent specified herein and\\nin Section 7(b)(6) hereof.\\n\\n         If no amount is payable in respect of the conditionally granted\\nperformance units, the award and such performance units shall be deemed to\\nhave been canceled, forfeited and surrendered, and the Associated Option, if\\nany, shall continue in effect in accordance with its terms.  If any amount is\\npayable in respect of the performance units and such units were granted in\\nconjunction with an Associated Option, the Committee shall, within 30 days\\nafter the determination of the Committee referred to in the first sentence of\\nSection 7(b)(6), determine, in its sole discretion, either:\\n\\n              (A)  to cancel in full the Associated Option, in which event the\\nvalue of the performance units payable pursuant to Sections 7(b)(5) and (6)\\nshall be paid;\\n\\n              (B)  to cancel in full the performance units, in which event no\\namount shall be paid to the participant in respect thereof but the Associated\\nOption shall continue in effect in accordance with its terms; or\\n\\n              (C)  to cancel some, but not all, of the performance units, in\\nwhich event the value of the performance units payable pursuant to Sections\\n7(b)(5) and (6) which have not been canceled shall be paid and the Associated\\nOption shall be canceled with respect to that number of shares equal to the\\nnumber of conditionally granted performance units that remain payable.\\n\\n                                E-4-9\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n         Any action taken by the Committee pursuant to the preceding sentence\\nshall be uniform with respect to all awards having the same award period.  If\\nthe Committee takes no such action, it shall be deemed to have determined to\\ncancel in full the award in accordance with clause (B) above.\\n\\n  8.     Determination of Breach of Conditions:  The determination of the\\nCommittee as to whether an event has occurred resulting in a forfeiture or a\\ntermination or reduction of the Company\\'s obligations in accordance with the\\nprovisions of the Plan shall be conclusive.\\n\\n  9.     Adjustment in the Event of Change in Stock:  In the event of changes\\nin the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of stock dividends,\\nrecapitalization, mergers, consolidations, split-ups, combinations or\\nexchanges of shares and the like, the aggregate number and class of shares\\navailable under the Plan, and the number, class and the price of shares\\nsubject to outstanding options and/or awards and the number of performance\\nunits and/or the dollar value of each unit shall be appropriately adjusted by\\nthe Committee, whose determination shall be conclusive.\\n\\n  10.    Taxes:  In connection with the transfer of shares of Common Stock to\\nan optionee, subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, as the result of the\\nexercise of a nonqualified stock option or a stock appreciation right, or to a\\nparticipant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, upon payment of an\\naward, the Company shall have the right to retain or sell without notice,\\nor to demand surrender of, shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value\\n(taking into account any commissions or other expenses the Company may incur\\nupon the sale of such shares) on the date that the amount required by any\\ngovernmental entity to be withheld or otherwise deducted and paid with respect\\nto such transfer (\"Withholding Tax\") is to be determined (the \"Tax Date\")\\nsufficient to cover the amount of any Applicable Tax (the amount of\\nWithholding Tax plus the incremental amount determined on the basis of the\\nhighest marginal tax rate applicable to such optionee or participant, Federal\\nInsurance Contribution Act taxes or other governmental impost or levy), and to\\nmake payment (or to reimburse itself for payment made) to the appropriate\\ntaxing authority of an amount in cash equal to the amount of such Applicable\\nTax, remitting any balance to the optionee or participant.  Notwithstanding\\nthe foregoing, if the stock options have been transferred, the optionee shall\\nprovide the Company with funds sufficient to pay such Withholding or\\nApplicable Tax.  Furthermore, if such optionee does not satisfy his withholding\\nobligation, the transferee may provide the funds sufficient to enable the\\nCompany to pay such Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax.  However, if the stock\\noptions have been transferred, the Company shall have no right to retain or\\nsell without notice, or to demand surrender from the transferee of, shares of\\nCommon Stock in order to pay such Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax.\\n\\n  An optionee or participant who is not an executive officer of the Company\\nsubject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be entitled to satisfy the\\nobligation to pay any Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax, by providing the\\nCompany with funds sufficient to enable the Company to pay such Withholding\\nTax or Applicable Tax or by requiring the Company to retain or to accept upon\\ndelivery thereof by the optionee or participant shares of Common Stock\\nsufficient in value (determined in accordance with the last sentence of the\\npreceding paragraph), to cover the amount of such Withholding Tax or\\nApplicable Tax.  Each election by an optionee or participant to have shares\\nretained or to deliver shares for this purpose shall be subject to the following\\nrestrictions:  (i) the election must be in writing and be made on or prior to\\nthe Tax Date; (ii) the election must be irrevocable; (iii) the election shall\\nbe subject to the disapproval of the Committee.\\n\\n  11.    Amendment of the Plan: The Board of Directors may amend or suspend\\nthe Plan at any time and from time to time.  No such amendment of the Plan\\nmay, however, increase the maximum number of shares to be offered under\\noptions or awards, or change the manner of determining the option price, or\\nchange the designation of employees or class of employees eligible to receive\\noptions or awards, or permit the transfer or issue of stock before payment\\ntherefor in full, or, without the written consent of the optionee or\\nparticipant, alter or impair any option or award previously granted under the\\nPlan, Prior Plan or LTPAP.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an option has\\nbeen transferred in accordance with Section 6(b)(6), written consent of the\\ntransferee (and not the optionee) shall be necessary to alter or impair any\\noption or award previously granted under the Plan.\\n\\n                                E-4-10\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\n  12.

Such election shall be\\ndeemed a Retirement for purposes of this Section 12 and all other purposes of\\nthis Plan.\\n\\n  13.    Miscellaneous:  By accepting any benefits under the Plan, each\\noptionee or participant and each person claiming under or through such optionee\\nor participant shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated acceptance and\\nratification of, and consent to, any action taken or made to be taken or made\\nunder the Plan by the Company, the Board, the Committee or any other Committee\\nappointed by the Board.  No participant or any person claiming under or\\nthrough him shall have any right or interest, whether vested or otherwise, in\\nthe Plan or in any option, or stock appreciation right or award thereunder,\\ncontingent or otherwise, unless and until all of the terms, conditions and\\nprovisions of the Plan and the Agreement that affect such participant or such\\nother person shall have been complied with.  Nothing contained in the Plan or\\nin any Agreement shall require the Company to segregate or earmark any cash or\\nother property.  Neither the adoption of the Plan nor its operation shall in\\nany way affect the rights and powers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries\\nor Affiliates to dismiss and/or discharge any employee at any time.\\n\\n  14.

Deferred Compensation Account.\\n\\n     There shall be established on the books of the Company for each\\nparticipant a deferred compensation account in the participant\\'s name.\\n\\n\\n     Section 4.    Amount of Deferral.\\n\\n     Five Hundred (500) Share Units payable, as of February 1 of each year, to\\nthe participant for membership on the Board of Directors shall be deferred and\\ncredited to such participant\\'s deferred compensation account as Share Units\\nequal to the number of shares of the Company\\'s common stock which could have\\nbeen purchased with the amounts deferred, determined by dividing the dollar\\nvalue of the amounts deferred by the fair market value of a share of the\\nCompany\\'s common share as reported in The Wall Street Journal on the effective\\ndate of such deferral until the cessation of the participant\\'s service as a\\nDirector.  Twenty-five (25) percent of the basic fee payable to the\\nparticipant for membership on the Board of Directors shall be deferred and\\ncredited to such participant\\'s deferred compensation account as Share Units\\nequal to the number of shares of the Company\\'s common stock which could have\\nbeen purchased with the amounts deferred, determined by dividing the dollar\\nvalue of the amounts deferred by the fair market value of a share of the\\nCompany\\'s common share as reported in The Wall Street Journal on the effective\\ndate of such deferral until such time as the participant meets a guideline\\nlevel of Share Unit or Company common stock ownership established by the\\nExecutive Compensation Committee of the Company.  A participant may elect, by\\nfiling the appropriate form pursuant to Section 9, to defer receipt for any\\ncalendar year of either (1) all of the compensation payable to the participant\\nfor serving on the Board of Directors and any committee thereof, (2) only the\\nbasic fee payable to the participant for membership on the Board of Directors,\\nor (3) any percentage, in excess of twenty-five percent of the basic fee,\\nspecified by the participant of the compensation payable to the participant\\nspecified in clause (1) hereof.\\n\\n                                E-5-1\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\n     Section 5.    Form and Computation of Deferred Amounts.\\n\\n     Effective with respect to amounts deferred after the Effective Date of\\nthe Plan and subject to Section 4, a participant, at the time he elects to\\nparticipate in the Plan, shall elect to have the amounts deferred credited to\\nsuch participant\\'s deferred compensation account as Treasury Units or Dollar\\nUnits each equal to the number of shares of the Company\\'s common stock which\\ncould have been purchased with the amounts deferred determined by dividing the\\ndollar value of the amounts deferred by the fair market value of a share of\\nthe Company\\'s common share as reported in The Wall Street Journal on the\\neffective date of such deferral.  Such deferrals shall be allocated to\\nTreasury Units, Dollar Units and/or Share Units in increments of 0%, 33 1/3%,\\n50%, 66 2/3% or 100%.  The amount credited to a participant\\'s deferred\\ncompensation account as Treasury Units shall be credited with interest at a\\nrate to be set by the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company in\\nJanuary of each year after a review of the six-month United States Treasury\\nbill discount rates for the preceding year.  The amount credited to a\\nparticipant\\'s deferred compensation account as Dollar Units shall be credited\\nwith interest at a rate to be set by the Executive Compensation Committee in\\nJanuary of each year after a review of investment return on the invested cash\\nof the Company.  Upon payment by the Company of dividends on its common stock,\\nthe amount credited to a participant\\'s deferred compensation account as Share\\nUnits shall be credited with an amount equal to the number of Share Units\\nmultiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of such dividend\\nand the denominator of which is the fair market value of a Share of the\\nCompany\\'s common stock as reported in The Wall Street Journal on the day such\\ndividend is payable.  The amount of Share Units in a participant\\'s deferred\\ncompensation account shall be adjusted in the discretion of the Executive\\nCompensation Committee to take into account a merger, consolidation,\\nreorganization, recapitalization, stock split or other change in corporate\\nstructure of capitalization affecting the Company\\'s common stock.\\n\\n\\n     Section 6.    Period of Deferral.\\n\\n     Subject to Section 4, a participant may elect to defer receipt of\\ncompensation either (1) until a specified year in the future, (2) until the\\ncessation of the participant\\'s service as a Director or (3) until the end of\\nthe calendar year in which the cessation of the participant\\'s service as a\\nDirector occurs.  If alternative (1) is elected, payment will be made or will\\ncommence within sixty days after the beginning of the year specified; if\\nalternative (2) is elected, payment will be made or will commence within sixty\\ndays after the cessation of the participant\\'s service as a Director; and if\\nalternative (3) is elected, payment will be made or will commence within sixty\\ndays after the end of the calendar year in which the cessation of the\\nparticipant\\'s service as a Director occurs.\\n\\n\\n     Section 7.    Form of Payment.\\n\\n     A participant may elect to receive the compensation deferred under the\\nPlan in either (1) a lump sum in cash or (2) a number of installments in cash,\\nnot more than ten, as specified by the participant.  If installment payments\\nare elected, the amount of each installment shall be equal to the balance in\\nthe participant\\'s deferred compensation account divided by the number of\\ninstallments remaining to be paid (including the installment in question).\\n\\n                                E-5-2\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\n     Section 8.    Death Prior to Receipt.\\n\\n     A participant may elect that, in the event he or she dies prior to\\nreceipt of any or all of the amounts payable pursuant to this Plan, any\\namounts remaining in the participant\\'s deferred compensation account shall be\\npaid to the participant\\'s estate in cash in either (1) a lump sum within sixty\\ndays following notification to the Company of the participant\\'s death or (2) a\\nnumber of annual installments, not more than ten, as specified by the\\nparticipant.  If alternative (2) is elected and payment to the participant\\npursuant to clause (2) of Section 7 has not commenced prior to death, the\\ninitial installment payment hereunder shall be made sixty days after\\nnotification to the Company of the participant\\'s death, and the amount of each\\nsuch installment shall be determined as provided in the last sentence of\\nSection 7.  If alternative (2) is elected and payment to the participant\\npursuant to clause (2) of Section 7 had commenced prior to death, the\\ninstallment payments to the participant\\'s estate shall be made at the same\\ntime and in the same amount as such payments would have been made to the\\nparticipant had he or she survived.  For purposes of this Section 8, any\\namounts deferred as Share Units shall be converted to Dollar Units by\\nmultiplying the number of Share Units credited to a participant\\'s deferred\\ncompensation account on the date of his death by the fair market value of a\\nshare of the Company\\'s common stock on such date as reported in The Wall\\nStreet Journal.\\n\\n\\n     Section 9.    Time of Election of Deferral.\\n\\n     An election to defer compensation may be made by (i) a nominee for\\nelection as a Director prior to his/her election for the calendar year in\\nwhich he/she is being elected (except that a person elected a Director by the\\nBoard of Directors may make an election to defer compensation within 30 days\\nafter his/her election as a Director, in which event such election to defer\\ncompensation shall be effective only with respect to compensation paid after\\nthe election to defer compensation is made) and (ii) a person then currently\\nserving as a Director for the next succeeding calendar year no later than the\\npreceding December 31.

Status of Previous Deferrals.\\n\\n     Any deferral election made under the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Amended\\nand Restated Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the \"Prior\\nPlan\") shall be subject to and governed by the terms of the Prior Plan.\\n\\n\\n     Section 11.

Participant\\'s Rights Unsecured.\\n\\n     The right of any participant to receive future payments under the\\nprovisions of the Plan shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets\\nof the Company.\\n\\n\\n     Section 15.

The Company considers\\nthe overall protection of its patent, trademark and license rights to be of\\nmaterial value and acts to protect these rights from infringement.  The\\nCompany believes that no single patent or license is of material importance\\nin relation to the business as a whole.\\n\\n\\nCOMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS\\n- ---------------------------------------\\n\\nThe markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad based,\\nheavily competitive and include many competitors.

The products of the\\npharmaceutical products segment and the medical devices segment are promoted\\non a national and international basis in medical journals and directly to the\\nmedical profession.

Bristol-Myers\\nSquibb\\'s products are principally sold to the wholesale and retail trade both\\nnationally and internationally.  Certain products of the pharmaceutical\\nproducts and medical devices segments are also sold to other drug\\nmanufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession.

Management continues to\\nplace great emphasis on these activities. Pharmaceutical research and\\ndevelopment is carried out by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research\\nInstitute which has major facilities in Princeton and New Brunswick, New\\nJersey, Wallingford, Connecticut and Seattle, Washington. Pharmaceutical\\nresearch and development is also carried out at various other facilities in\\nthe United States and in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the\\nUnited Kingdom.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,276 million in 1996, $1,199 million in 1995 and\\n$1,108 million in 1994 on company sponsored research and development\\nactivities.  Pharmaceutical research and development spending, as a percentage\\nof pharmaceutical sales, was 12.3% in 1996 compared to 12.9% in 1995 and 13.6%\\nin 1994.\\n\\n\\nREGULATION\\n- ----------\\n\\nMost aspects of the Company\\'s business are subject to some degree of\\ngovernment regulation in the countries in which its operations are conducted.\\nThe Company\\'s policy is to comply fully with all regulatory requirements\\napplying to its products and operations.  For some products, and in some\\ncountries, government regulation is significant and, in general, there is a\\ntrend to more stringent regulation.  The Company devotes significant time,\\neffort and expense addressing the extensive governmental regulatory\\nrequirements applicable to its business.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\\n\\nBreast Implant Litigation\\n- ------------------------------\\n\\nReference is made to Note 15 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual\\nReport.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 1996, approximately 22,000 plaintiffs had filed suit\\nagainst the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC),\\nand certain other companies, in federal and state courts and in certain\\nCanadian provincial courts, alleging damages for personal injuries of various\\ntypes resulting from polyurethane covered breast implants and smooth walled\\nbreast implants formerly manufactured by MEC or its predecessors.  A number\\nof other manufacturers of breast implants, as well as suppliers of component\\nparts and other parties, are also defendants in many of these cases.  The\\nplaintiffs typically seek compensatory damages for alleged medical conditions\\nand emotional distress as well as punitive damages.  Some of these women have\\nsued numerous manufacturers without specifying the manufacturer of the\\nimplants involved.  The majority of the suits are presently stayed.  Those\\nthat are not stayed have been filed by plaintiffs who have opted out of the\\nRevised Settlement, which is described below.\\n\\nIn addition to individual suits, the Company has been named as a defendant,\\ntogether with other defendants, in a number of class action lawsuits,\\nincluding one pending in Louisiana entitled IN RE: LOUISIANA BREAST IMPLANT\\nCLASS ACTION (previously SPITZFADEN, ET AL. VS. DOW CORNING CORP., ET AL.),\\nNo. 92-2589, purportedly consisting of all Louisiana residents who have opted\\nout of the Revised Settlement described below.  The Company is also a\\ndefendant in a purported class action brought on behalf of children allegedly\\nexposed to silicone in utero and through breast milk.  (FEUER, ET AL., V.\\nMCGHAN, ET AL., U.S.D.C., E. Dist. NY, 93-0146.)  The suit, which has not been\\ncertified as a class action, names all breast implant manufacturers as\\ndefendants and seeks to establish a medical monitoring fund.  On April 11,\\n1996, a class action on behalf of all women in the Canadian province of\\nBritish Columbia was certified in the provincial court of British Columbia on\\nthe single issue of whether silicone gel breast implants are reasonably fit\\nfor their intended purpose (HARRINGTON V. DOW CORNING CORPORATION ET AL.,\\nSupreme Court, British Columbia, C954330).\\n\\nThe Company is a participant in a class action settlement approved by the\\nHonorable Sam C. Pointer, Jr., Chief Judge of the United States District Court\\nfor the Northern District of Alabama (LINDSEY, ET AL., V. DOW CORNING, ET AL.,\\nCV-94-P-11558-S), before whom all federal breast implant cases were\\nconsolidated for pretrial purposes.  On December 22, 1995, Judge Pointer\\napproved a revised settlement program (Revised Settlement) for resolution of\\nclaims seeking damages for personal injuries from allegedly defective breast\\nimplants.  The Revised Settlement arises out of a settlement approved by the\\nCourt on September 1, 1994.  On January 16, 1996, the Company, Baxter\\nHealthcare Corporation and Baxter International (collectively, Baxter), and\\nMinnesota, Mining & Manufacturing Company (3M) (hereinafter, the Settling\\nDefendants) each paid $125 million into a court-established fund as an initial\\nreserve to pay claims under the Revised Settlement.\\n\\n\\n                                    -  6  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nThe fifteen-year Revised Settlement generally provides benefits to those\\nbreast implant recipients, other than foreign claimants, who have had at least\\none breast implant manufactured by one of the Settling Defendants (or their\\npredecessors or subsidiaries).  Several kinds of benefits are available for\\neligible participants with breast implants made by companies affiliated with\\nBristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter and 3M: (1) for current claimants, compensation\\ngenerally ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 based on disease and disability\\ndefinitions of the original settlement, plus supplemental benefits of an\\nadditional $15,000 to $50,000 for claimants with ruptured implants; (2) for\\ncurrent claimants seeking higher benefits and for other registrants,\\ncompensation ranging from $75,000 to $250,000 based on new disease and\\ndisability definitions (Long-Term Benefits); and (3) although the Settling\\nDefendants are not recommending removal of implants absent some specific\\nmedical reason, a $3,000 payment for those class members (other than late\\nregistrants) who seek removal of implants.  In addition, current claimants are\\neligible for an advance payment of $5,000, and other existing registrants are\\neligible for an advance payment of $1,000.  For certain current claimants,\\nbenefits would be payable regardless of the number of claimants seeking\\ncompensation, regardless of the total dollar value of approved claims, and\\nregardless of the outcome of appeals from the order approving the settlement.\\nFor other claimants, benefits would be subject to an aggregate $755 million\\nlimit for all participating companies over the fifteen year life of the\\nprogram.  The Company\\'s individual aggregate limit for such benefits is $400\\nmillion.  In the event the dollar value of the future claims subject to the\\nlimit exceeds this amount, claimants may be afforded additional opt-out rights\\nbut without the right to assert punitive or other statutory multiple damage\\nclaims.  The Company\\'s obligations to make payments under the Revised\\nSettlement are not affected by the number of class members electing to opt-out\\nof the settlement or the number of class members making claims under it.\\nHowever, the Company\\'s obligations to fund Long-Term Benefits are cancelable\\nif certain provisions of the Revised Settlement are disapproved on appeal.\\n\\nThe Revised Settlement was the subject of an appeal filed by certain foreign\\nbreast implant recipients.   In November 1996, the Settling Defendants settled\\nthat appeal, and the benefits of the Revised Settlement will be extended, with\\ncertain modifications, to foreign breast implant recipients.  Pursuant to the\\nsettlement, the Settling Defendants each paid approximately $8.3 million into\\na court-approved settlement fund as an initial reserve for payment of foreign\\nclaims.  Other appeals related to the Revised Settlement are pending.\\n\\nIn early 1996, notices describing the Revised Settlement were mailed to breast\\nimplant recipients, including the approximately 380,000 domestic class members\\n(with implants of all manufacturers, not just Bristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter and\\n3M) who originally registered with the settlement.  The claims office has\\nreported that as of December 16, 1996, approximately 122,000 of these\\nregistrants had submitted proof of manufacturer documentation, which will\\nenable the claims office to determine whether they have a breast implant made\\nby a Settling Defendant.  The claims office has further reported that, as of\\nDecember 16, 1996, over 52,000 of the 122,000 registrants who submitted proof\\nof manufacturer had been sent Notification of Status letters advising them of\\ntheir status in the settlement.  Of the recipients of Notification of Status\\nletters, over 35,000 have established to the satisfaction of the claims office\\nthat they have a Settling Defendant\\'s implant and have chosen to participate\\nin the settlement, while approximately 3,300 opted out.  The decisions of the\\nremaining recipients of Notification of Status letters were not reported as\\n\\n\\n                                    -  7  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nof December 31, 1996.\\n\\nThe right of registered class members to opt-out terminates 45 days after the\\ndate of such a class member\\'s Notification of Status letter.  The claims\\noffice has been sending Notification of Status letters to class members on an\\nongoing basis, and is expected to continue to do so during the first half of\\n1997.  The claims office has reported that, as of December 16, 1996,\\napproximately 8,000 of the original 380,000 domestic registrants (with\\nimplants of all manufacturers) opted out after receiving the initial notice\\nof the Revised Settlement in 1996.  Based on all the information supplied to\\nthe Company as of December 31, 1996, the Company has identified approximately\\n3,300 such opt-outs as plaintiffs in pending suits which name the Company as\\na defendant.  Many of these plaintiffs, however, have not yet affirmatively\\nidentified the manufacturer of their implants, and the total number of\\nopt-outs with claims against the Company will not be known until the opt-out\\nperiod ends and complete information is made available.  In addition,\\napproximately 7,100 domestic breast implant recipients with implants of all\\nmanufacturers, including manufacturers not participating in the Revised\\nSettlement, had previously opted out in connection with the original 1994\\napproval of this class action settlement.  Of this group, the Company has\\nidentified approximately 2,300 domestic opt-outs, a large number of whom\\nreside in Texas, as allegedly having MEC implants and as having pending claims\\nagainst the Company.  Because the opt-out period for most class members has\\nnot expired, and because our information is incomplete, it is not reasonably\\npossible at this time to estimate on any reliable and precise basis either the\\ntotal number of women who will opt-out of the Revised Settlement or, of those\\nwho opt-out, the number who will file lawsuits against the Company.\\n\\nThe cost of the settlement is dependent upon complex and varying factors,\\nincluding the number of class members that participate, the kinds of claims\\nasserted and approved under the settlement, and their dollar value.  In light\\nof the continuing uncertainties attendant to these and other factors, it is\\nnot possible to achieve any precision at this time in estimating the cost of\\nthe settlement to the Company.\\n\\nIn May of 1996, the Company, together with other Settling Defendants, entered\\ninto a $50 million settlement of claims asserted by certain health insurers\\nbased upon payments made or benefits provided by insurers and represented\\nhealth plans to participating registrants that allegedly involve or relate to\\nsilicone gel breast implants.  The Company has paid $20.2 million to the\\nsettlement, which extinguishes the potential claims of the majority of the\\nU.S. commercial and non-governmental health care insurer market against both\\nthe defendants and settlement class members.\\n\\nIn July of 1995, the Company entered into a $20.5 million (U.S. funds) class\\naction settlement with plaintiff representatives in the provinces of Ontario\\nand Quebec.  The class includes persons who have or had MEC breast implants\\nand who reside in Ontario and Quebec or who received their MEC implants there.\\nThe settlement, which had minimal opt-outs, has been approved by the\\nprovincial courts of Ontario and Quebec.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s insurers have been notified of the breast implant claims and the\\nRevised Settlement, and generally have reserved their rights or declined to\\nconfirm coverage.  In 1993, the Company commenced litigation in state court,\\nJefferson County, Texas, against most of the Company\\'s insurers, seeking\\n\\n                                    -  8  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\ndamages and a declaration of coverage.  In the litigation, the Company has\\nobtained favorable rulings on certain coverage issues which, in the Company\\'s\\njudgment, make it probable that certain policies issued by insurers in the\\n1982-86 period will be held to respond to the claims.  The Company has entered\\ninto settlement agreements with certain insurers providing cash or confirming\\ncoverage of a substantial amount of expected insurance proceeds.  A trial of\\nthe insurance coverage case currently is expected in the second quarter of\\n1997.\\n\\nThe cost to the Company of resolving opt-out claims is subject to a number of\\ncomplex uncertainties.  Primary among them is the difficulty of estimating\\nwith any precision the quantity and quality of such claims.  While there have\\nbeen large judgments in some cases, defendants  have won more trials than they\\nhave lost, and in 1996, the Company\\'s trial experience was generally\\nfavorable.  The Company has maintained throughout this litigation that breast\\nimplants do not cause disease and recent medical and scientific information\\ncontinues to support the Company\\'s position.  The Company\\'s view has found\\nstrong support in the December 1996 decision of a federal judge in Oregon, who\\nruled to exclude the testimony of plaintiffs\\' experts concerning a causal link\\nbetween silicone gel breast implants and systemic illness on the ground that\\nit fails to satisfy standards for reliability under current Supreme Court\\nguidelines.  In addition, a science panel appointed by Judge Pointer is in the\\nprocess of reviewing the scientific literature regarding any relation between\\nbreast implants and disease, and is expected to report its findings in 1997.\\nThe results of continuing medical research and a variety of additional\\nfactors, including the success of other legal defenses and the success of the\\nRevised Settlement program, may substantially affect the cost of resolving\\nopt-out cases.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a charge of $500 million\\nbefore taxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant cases.\\nThe charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses,\\noffset by $1 billion of expected insurance proceeds.  In the fourth quarters\\nof 1994 and 1995, the Company recorded additional special charges of $750\\nmillion before taxes ($488 million after taxes) and $950 million before taxes\\n($590 million after taxes), respectively, related to breast implant product\\nliability claims.  The Company views the Revised Settlement, litigation\\nresults in 1996, and ongoing science and medicine about breast implants as\\nfavorable developments.  Nonetheless, since the ultimate effects of the\\nRevised Settlement and the ongoing litigation cannot at present be reasonably\\npredicted, after more information becomes available it is possible that an\\nadditional charge to earnings might be required with respect to breast implant\\nlitigation.  In the opinion of the Company, such charge, if taken, should not\\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s liquidity or consolidated\\nfinancial position, although it is possible that it might have a material\\nadverse effect on the Company\\'s results of operations for the period in which\\nthe charge would be recorded.\\n\\n\\nInfant Formula Matters\\n- ---------------------------\\n\\nThe Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are or have been defendants\\nin a number of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of\\npurported statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula products\\n\\n\\n                                    -  9  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nand by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi, alleging\\na price fixing conspiracy and other violations of state antitrust or deceptive\\ntrade practice laws and seeking penalties and other relief.  On June 7, 1996,\\nthe Company reached a settlement covering all the then pending infant formula\\nindirect purchaser cases except the case in Massachusetts and the case brought\\nby the Louisiana Attorney General.  On September 29, 1996, a federal district\\ncourt in Tallahassee, Florida, entered an order in favor of the defendants,\\neffectively dismissing the Louisiana  Attorney General action.  No appeal was\\ntaken from that decision.  In December 1996, the Company entered an agreement\\nin principle to settle the Massachusetts action.  Final court approval of the\\nabove settlements has been granted in every case except those pending in\\nLouisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan and Nevada.  In Louisiana on January 21,\\n1997, the court entered an order disapproving the settlement.  In the other\\njurisdictions, joint motions for final approval of the settlement have either\\nnot yet been filed (Massachusetts) or not yet been ruled upon (Michigan and\\nNevada).  The Company believes that these actions are without merit and that\\ntheir ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations, liquidity or consolidated financial position.\\n\\n\\nPrescription Drug Litigation\\n- ----------------------------\\n\\nAs of December 31, 1996, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions\\nbrought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical\\nmanufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various\\nfederal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains and\\nindependent drugstores, suing either individually or as a representative of\\na nationwide class of retail pharmacies that has been certified.  These cases,\\nwhich have been coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States\\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Illinois, all seek treble damages\\nand injunctive relief on account of an alleged antitrust conspiracy concerning\\nthe pricing and marketing of brand name prescription drugs; the plaintiffs who\\nare suing individually are also asserting claims of unlawful price\\ndiscrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act.  Discovery has been completed\\nwith respect to claims concerning the alleged antitrust conspiracy.\\nCompletion of additional discovery with respect to Robinson-Patman Act claims\\nagainst the Company has been stayed.  Plaintiffs in the class action have\\nindicated that they intend to claim damages, before trebling, ranging from 5%\\nto approximately 20% of the value of their purchases of brand name\\nprescription drugs from defendants since October 15, 1989.  It is estimated\\nthat the class members who have not opted out represent approximately\\ntwo-thirds of retail pharmacy purchases of brand name prescription drugs during\\nthe alleged damages period.  As of May 1, 1996, the Company, without admitting\\nany wrongdoing, reached an amended agreement to settle the class action.  The\\nsettlement, as amended, has been approved by the Court, and purported appeals\\nfrom that approval are pending.  On April 4, 1996, the Court denied motions\\nfor summary judgment brought by the drug manufacturer defendants, including\\nthe Company, with respect to the conspiracy claims asserted by retail\\npharmacies that have opted out of the class.  The largest opt-out retailer\\nplaintiffs have purported to quantify their conspiracy damage claims against\\nthe defendants, including the Company, asserting damages aggregating\\napproximately $2.4 billion before trebling.  An interlocutory appeal by the\\ndrug manufacturer defendants, including the Company, from an April 4, 1996\\nruling by the District Court that denied their motions for summary judgment\\n\\n                                    -  10  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nas to damage claims based on retailers\\' purchases from wholesalers is pending\\nin the Court of Appeals.  Class action cases brought by retail pharmacies in\\nstate courts against a similar group of defendants and alleging similar\\ngrounds under state law are proceeding in California, Alabama, Wisconsin and\\nMinnesota.  The California court has certified a class of California retail\\npharmacies.  The Wisconsin court has certified a class of Wisconsin retail\\npharmacies.  Class action cases brought by consumers in state courts against\\na similar group of defendants and alleging similar grounds under state law\\nhave been brought in California, Washington, New York, Arizona, Maine,\\nAlabama, Michigan, Minnesota, the District of Columbia, Wisconsin, Kansas,\\nFlorida and Tennessee.  The consumer actions brought in Washington and New\\nYork have been dismissed; appeals are pending in both states.  The California\\ncourt has certified a class of California consumers.  In the Alabama case, the\\nAlabama court had purported to certify a class consisting of consumers in\\nAlabama and other states, including  the District of Columbia, Kansas, Maine,\\nMichigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico and Wisconsin, but that order has\\nbeen vacated.  A class of consumers has been certified in the District of\\nColumbia consumer case, while class certification has been denied in the\\nMinnesota consumer case.  In July 1996, the Company received a subpoena from\\nthe Federal Trade Commission in an investigation it is conducting to determine\\nwhether U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers have engaged in unfair methods of\\ncompetition by engaging in unlawful concerted activities on prices of\\npharmaceutical products.  The Company believes that these actions are without\\nmerit and that their ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse\\neffect on the Company\\'s results of operations, liquidity or consolidated\\nfinancial position.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnvironmental Matters\\n- ---------------------\\n\\nThe Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in,\\na number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection Agency or\\ncomparable state agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response\\nCompensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or comparable state laws\\ndirected at the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.  While it is not possible\\nto predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, the Company believes\\nthat the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material\\nadverse effect on the Company\\'s results of operations, liquidity or\\nconsolidated financial position.\\n\\n\\nItem 4.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\\n        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nNineteen ninety-six marked another year of record growth in sales and earnings\\nfor Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Worldwide sales were $15.1 billion, a 9% increase\\nover 1995.  Domestic sales increased 10% to $8.5 billion, while international\\nsales increased 9% to $6.6 billion.  Exchange rate fluctuations had an\\nunfavorable effect of 2% on worldwide sales and 4% on international sales.\\nSales growth resulted from an 11% increase due to volume with no changes\\noverall from pricing activity.  In 1996, significant contributions to the\\nCompany\\'s sales growth were made by the thirty-six products, representing all\\nfour business segments, with annual sales of at least $100 million.  In fact,\\nsixteen of these products experienced double- digit sales growth or better.\\n\\nEarnings before income taxes increased 10% to $4,013 million in 1996, net\\nearnings increased 10% to $2,850 million and earnings per share increased 11%\\nto $2.84, excluding the 1995 charges. Including these charges, earnings before\\nincome taxes were $4,013 million in 1996 and $2,402 million in 1995, net\\nearnings were $2,850 million in 1996 and $1,812 million in 1995, and earnings\\nper share were $2.84 in 1996 and $1.79 in 1995.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb\\'s financial position remains strong.  At December 31,\\n1996, the Company held $2.2 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable\\nsecurities.  Cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.6 billion and\\ncontinued to be the primary source of funding to finance research, new product\\ndevelopment and introductions, capital spending and working capital needs.  It\\nwas also used to pay dividends of $1.5 billion in 1996.  Dividends per common\\nshare were $1.50 in 1996, increasing from $1.48 per share paid in 1995.  In\\nDecember 1996, the Company announced an additional dividend increase, the\\ntwenty-fifth consecutive year that dividends have increased.  The 1997\\nindicated annual payment is $1.52 per share compared with the $1.50 per share\\npaid in 1996.  With this 1997 annual payment, Bristol-Myers Squibb dividends\\nhave increased at a compound annual growth rate of 8% over the past 10 years.\\nBristol-Myers Squibb\\'s strong financial position is evidenced further by its\\ntriple-A credit rating from both Moody\\'s and Standard & Poor\\'s, making\\nBristol-Myers Squibb one of only eight U.S. companies with this distinction.\\nAccordingly, the Company has substantial borrowing capacity at its disposal.\\n\\nTotal market capitalization was $54.5 billion as of December 31, 1996, a 25.7%\\nincrease over last year.  Total return to shareholders, capital appreciation\\ntogether with reinvested dividends, was 32.1% for 1996, which compares\\nfavorably to the 23.0% return of the Standard & Poor\\'s 500.\\n\\nIn March 1996, the Board of Directors extended the Company\\'s share repurchase\\nprogram, increasing the program\\'s authorization to 150 million shares.  During\\n1996, the Company purchased 19 million shares of common stock at a cost of $852\\nmillion, bringing the total shares acquired since the program\\'s inception to\\n107 million.\\n\\nOn December 3, 1996, the Company\\'s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one\\nstock split of the common stock of the Company, effective February 1997.  The\\nBoard of Directors also recommended that an amendment be considered for\\nstockholder approval at the annual meeting of stockholders to increase the\\nnumber of authorized shares of common stock from 1.5 billion to 2.25 billion.\\nAll share and per share information presented herein has been adjusted for the\\neffect of the stock split.\\n\\n                                    -  19  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nNet Sales and Earnings\\n\\nWorldwide sales increased 9% in 1996 to $15.1 billion, compared with increases\\nof 15% and 5% in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The consolidated sales growth\\nresulted from an 11% increase due to volume, a 2% decrease due to unfavorable\\nforeign exchange rate fluctuations and no changes overall from pricing\\nactivity.  In 1995, the 15% increase in sales reflected a 13% increase due to\\nvolume, while price increases and exchange rate fluctuations each contributed\\n1% to growth on a worldwide basis.  In 1994, the 5% increase in sales reflected\\na 4% increase due to volume, a 1% increase due to pricing and exchange rate\\nfluctuations had no effect.  Domestic sales increased 10% in both 1996 and 1995\\nand 4% in 1994, while international sales increased 9% in 1996, 22% in 1995 and\\n7% in 1994.  In general, the businesses of the Company\\'s industry segments are\\nnot seasonal.\\n\\nThe effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 29.0% in 1996\\ncompared to 24.6% and 27.9% in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Excluding the 1995\\nspecial charge and the provision for restructuring, the effective income tax\\nrate on earnings before income taxes was 29.0% in 1996 and 1995, and 29.5% in\\n1994.  The lower 1996 and 1995 effective income tax rates compared to 1994\\nresulted from increased income in lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially\\noffset by reduced benefits from operations in Puerto Rico.\\n\\nAs described in the notes to the financial statements, the Company recorded\\nspecial charges to earnings of $950 million before taxes, $590 million after\\ntaxes, or $.58 per share in the fourth quarter of 1995 and $750 million before\\ntaxes, $488 million after taxes or $.48 per share, in the fourth quarter of\\n1994.  Also, during the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company recorded a\\nprovision for restructuring of $310 million before taxes, $198 million after\\ntaxes, or $.20 per share.\\n\\nExpenses\\n\\nTotal costs and expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding the 1995 special\\ncharge and the provision for restructuring, were 73.4% in both 1996 and 1995\\ncompared with 72.4% in 1994.  In 1996, the increases in advertising and\\npromotion in support of new and existing products were offset by decreases in\\nmarketing, selling and administrative expenses and research and development\\nspending.  The increase in 1995 primarily resulted from increased advertising\\nand promotion expenditures in the nonprescription health products and\\ntoiletries and beauty aids segments.  In addition, gross margins in the\\nnonprescription health products segment were lower in 1995 than in the prior\\nyear, due to the Company\\'s expanded participation in the federal government\\'s\\nWomen, Infants and Children (WIC) program.\\n\\nAs a percentage of sales, cost of products sold remained relatively unchanged\\nat 26.3% in 1996 compared to 26.4% in 1995.  Excluding 1996 acquisitions, cost\\nof products sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 25.5% due to a\\nfavorable product mix, the introduction of a semi-synthetic material yielding\\nlower production costs for TAXOL*(R)(paclitaxel) and manufacturing efficiencies.\\nIn 1995, cost of products sold as a percentage of sales increased to 26.4% from\\n26.1% in 1994 as a result of the increased participation in the WIC program and\\nlower gross margins in connection with acquisitions, offset by a favorable\\nproduct mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies.\\n\\n                                    -  20  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,\\ndecreased to 26.1% in 1996 from 26.7% in 1995 and 26.4% in 1994.  In 1996,\\nincreases in marketing and selling expenses in the pharmaceutical segment were\\nmore than offset by decreases in administrative costs.\\n\\nAdvertising and promotion expenses in support of new and existing products\\nincreased 18% to $1,946 million in 1996 from $1,646 million in 1995,\\nprincipally due to incremental spending in the pharmaceutical and toiletries\\nand beauty aids segments, supporting direct-to-consumer campaigns and new\\nproduct launches, respectively.  In 1995, advertising and promotion expenses\\nincreased from 1994 levels primarily due to spending in support of new product\\nlaunches.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s investment in research and development totaled $1,276 million in\\n1996, an increase of 6% over 1995.  This spending level reflects the Company\\'s\\ncommitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and clinical\\ndevelopment in support of new products. Over the past 10 years, research and\\ndevelopment expenses have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 11%.\\nIn 1996, research and development spending dedicated to the discovery and\\ndevelopment of pharmaceutical products was 12.3% of pharmaceutical sales\\ncompared to 12.9% and 13.6% in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  During 1996 and\\n1995, the Company entered into a number of research alliances, licensing\\nagreements and biotechnology collaborations.   These agreements are providing\\nimportant new products as well as early stage compounds for further development\\nand new processes that will help us screen for new drugs more effectively.  Our\\ncollaboration with Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical company, has resulted in the\\nworldwide filings in 1996 for irbesartan, a drug that represents an advanced\\nclass of anti-hypertensive medicines.\\n\\nIndustry Segments\\n\\nThe Pharmaceutical Products Segment, which is the Company\\'s largest segment at\\n58% of total Company sales, increased 11% to $8,702 million in 1996.  Sales\\ngrowth resulted from a 13% increase in volume offset by a 2% decrease due to\\nthe unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Changes in\\nselling prices had no effect on sales growth.  Domestic and international sales\\nincreased 13% and 10%, respectively, primarily due to volume growth.  Excluding\\nCAPOTEN* sales (discussed below), pharmaceutical product sales increased 21%\\n(23% before the effect of foreign exchange).\\n\\nStrong sales increases by established pharmaceutical products more than offset\\na $377 million domestic decline, or 68%, and a $71 million international\\ndecline, or 7%, in sales of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)\\ninhibitor sold primarily under the trademark CAPOTEN*, due to the loss of its\\npatent exclusivity in the U.S. in February 1996.  Worldwide CAPOTEN* sales were\\n$1.1 billion in 1996.  During 1997, CAPOTEN* will lose its exclusivity in\\nseveral countries outside the U.S., which contributed $208 million of CAPOTEN*\\nsales in 1996.\\n\\nSales of cardiovascular drugs, the largest product group in the segment,\\ndecreased 3% to $2,816 million.  Excluding CAPOTEN* sales, cardiovascular drugs\\nincreased 26%.  Sales of PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol-lowering agent, were $1.1\\nbillion, an increase of 39%. PRAVACHOL* is the first and only cholesterol-\\nlowering drug of its kind proven to reduce the risk of a first heart attack.\\nThis important claim is founded upon the results of studies that demonstrated\\nimportant clinical benefits, including the landmark five-year Pravastatin\\nPrimary Prevention Study and the five-year Cholesterol and Recurrent Events\\n\\n                                    -  21  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n(CARE) trial.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)in July granted\\nexpanded labeling that cleared PRAVACHOL* for use with diet to help reduce the\\nrisk of first heart attack in people who have elevated cholesterol but no\\nhistory of heart disease.  With this indication, in September the Company\\nannounced a nationwide program, the PRAVACHOL* Public Awareness Program on First\\nHeart Attack Prevention, to raise awareness about the risks of a first heart\\nattack and to help motivate people to take action with their physicians to\\nreduce their risks.  The program focuses on the millions of Americans with high\\ncholesterol who are considered at risk of a first heart attack.  MONOPRIL*, a\\nsecond generation ACE inhibitor with once-a-day dosage, also increased with\\nstrong growth in both domestic and international markets.\\n\\nSales of anti-cancer drugs increased 23% to $1,971 million.  Sales of TAXOL*\\n(with an exclusivity period in the U.S. expiring in December 1997), the\\nCompany\\'s leading anti-cancer agent, increased 40% to $813 million.  In late\\n1992, TAXOL* was initially cleared in the U.S. and Canada for the treatment of\\npatients with ovarian cancer whose first-line or subsequent chemotherapy has\\nfailed, and, during 1993 and 1994, TAXOL* received clearance for marketing in\\na number of countries in Europe, Latin America and the Pacific area. In 1994,\\nTAXOL* received clearance in the U.S. for use in the treatment of breast cancer\\nafter failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or after\\nrelapse within six months of adjuvant chemotherapy.  In October 1996, TAXOL* was\\napproved in the United Kingdom for first-line use in the treatment of ovarian\\ncancer.  The Company announced in December 1996 an agreement with the National\\nInstitutes of Health to continue and extend its collaborative research for the\\ndevelopment of TAXOL*.  Sales of PARAPLATIN* (with an exclusivity period in the\\nU.S. expiring in April 2004), used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, also\\nincreased 16%.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of\\nVEPESID* (the exclusivity for which expired in the U.S. in November 1993) and\\nPLATINOL*.  In October 1996, the Company acquired Oncology Therapeutics Network,\\na specialty distributor of anti-cancer medicines and related products.\\n\\nAnti-infective drug sales were $1,856 million, an increase of 9% over the prior\\nyear.  Strong growth was recorded for ZERIT* and VIDEX*, the Company\\'s two\\nantiretroviral agents, both of which benefited from positive regulatory agency\\nactions in the U.S., Canada and Europe, and from ongoing clinical trials\\ndemonstrating efficacy in combination therapy.  During the third quarter, VIDEX*\\nreceived clearance from the FDA to be used for first-line treatment of HIV.\\nIn January 1997, a new oral solution of ZERIT*, representing a significant\\naddition to the limited therapeutic options available to treat HIV-infected\\ninfants and children, was introduced.  These actions are expanding markets for\\nboth products.  Sales of CEFZIL*, an oral cephalosporin used in the treatment\\nof respiratory infections, and MAXIPIME*, a fourth generation injectable\\ncephalosporin introduced in some international markets in 1995 and in the U.S.\\nin the third quarter of 1996, also contributed to the growth of anti-\\ninfectives.  In October 1996, CEFZIL* received clearance from the FDA for use\\nin the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in adult and pediatric patients.\\nGrowth of these products was partially offset by sales decreases in DURICEF* and\\nAMIKIN* due to generic competition.\\n\\nSales of central nervous system drugs increased 26% to $760 million, due to the\\nstrong growth of BUSPAR*, the Company\\'s novel anti-anxiety agent; SERZONE*, an\\nantidepressant that offers a low incidence of side effects; and STADOL NS*, a\\nprescription nasal spray analgesic.  Glucophage (the exclusivity period for\\nwhich expires in the U.S. in December 1999), an oral medication for non-insulin\\ndependent diabetes licensed from the French company Lipha for sale in the U.S.,\\nwas launched in 1995.  In 1996, Glucophage  continued to experience\\n\\n                                    -  22  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nexceptionally strong growth, due to its rapid acceptance in the U.S. market.\\nDermatological drug sales increased largely due to sales of DOVONEX*, a vitamin\\nD3 analog for the treatment of moderate psoriasis.\\n\\nIn 1995, pharmaceutical products segment sales increased 12%.  Increases in\\nsales of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, PARAPLATIN*, ZERIT*, MONOPRIL*, BUSPAR*, CEFZIL*,\\nand introductory sales of Glucophage, SERZONE* and MAXIPIME* were partially\\noffset by decreases in sales of AZACTAM*, VEPESID*, CORGARD*, ISOVUE* and\\nAMIKIN*.  In 1994, sales in the segment increased 7% due to increased sales of\\ncardiovascular, anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs offset in part by\\ndecreases in sales of diagnostic agents.\\n\\nOperating profit margin was relatively constant at 33.0% in 1996, 33.3% in\\n1995, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring, and 32.6% in 1994.\\n\\nSales in the Nonprescription Health Products Segment increased 10% to $2,750\\nmillion, reflecting a 12% increase due to volume and a 2% decrease due to the\\nunfavorable effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.   International sales\\nincreased 12% (16% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange), while\\ndomestic sales increased 9%. Sales of the milk-based ENFAMIL*, the Company\\'s\\nlargest-selling infant formula, as well as NUTRAMIGEN* and LACTOFREE* special\\ninfant formulas, performed well in both the U.S. and international markets.\\nMead Johnson Nutritional Group\\'s leadership in the WIC program allowed the\\nCompany to maintain its position as the U.S. market leader, while also\\nincreasing its share of the overall infant formula market.  Contributing to\\ninfant formula sales in the U.S. were several sole-source contracts awarded to\\nthe Company during the past year under the WIC program as well as gains in\\nnon-WIC segments.  BOOST* and SUSTACAL* adult nutritional beverages, launched\\ndirectly to consumers in the fourth quarter of 1995, and ALACTA NF*, a\\nnutritious beverage for pre-school age children, sold outside the U.S., also\\ncontributed to sales growth.  Sales of analgesic products increased 7% (11%\\nexcluding the effect of foreign exchange), due to volume growth from\\nEFFERALGAN*, DAFALGAN* and ASPIRINE UPSA*, from the UPSA Group, as well as\\nEXCEDRIN* and BUFFERIN*.  The KERI* line of skin care products and COMTREX*\\ncough/cold remedies also performed well.\\n\\nIn 1995, worldwide sales of nonprescription health products increased 22% (an\\nincrease of 11%, excluding the effect of the acquisition of the UPSA Group in\\nSeptember 1994), primarily due to increased sales of infant formulas, adult\\nconsumer nutritionals, EXCEDRIN*, BUFFERIN* and analgesics from the UPSA Group.\\nIn 1994, sales increased 4%, primarily due to increased sales of infant\\nformulas and analgesics.\\n\\nOperating profit margin improved to 19.9% in 1996, compared to 19.2% in 1995,\\nexcluding the 1995 provision for restructuring, partially as a result of\\nimproved manufacturing efficiencies.  In 1995, operating profit margin,\\nexcluding the 1995 provision for restructuring, decreased to 19.2% from 22.3%\\nin 1994, primarily due to lower margins on infant formula products and\\nincreased advertising and marketing expenses.\\n\\nIn the Medical Devices Segment, sales of $1,860 million reflected a 2% decrease\\nover prior year levels.  Volume gains of 3% were achieved despite a 3% decrease\\ndue to changes in selling prices.  Sales also were impacted by a 2% decrease\\ndue to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.  International sales\\ndecreased 3%(excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales\\nincreased 1%), while domestic sales decreased 1%. The Company\\'s Zimmer division\\ncontinues to be the world market share leader in knee and hip replacements.\\n\\n                                    -  23  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nWorldwide sales of prosthetic implants increased 1%, excluding the unfavorable\\neffect of foreign exchange, led by strong growth of the NEXGEN* Complete Knee\\nSolution.  The Company launched a major new hip replacement, the VERSYS* Hip\\nSystem, the most extensive component system on the market that features a\\nsingle set of instruments, in the fourth quarter of 1996.  ConvaTec, a division\\nof the Company, is the worldwide market share leader in ostomy care products.\\nSales of ostomy care products decreased over the prior year due to the overall\\nnegative impact of foreign exchange, product rationalization and the\\nrestructuring of distribution arrangements. Volume growth of the ACTIVE\\nLIFE/COLODRESS* product line was achieved in international markets.  Sales of\\nwound care products decreased.  ConvaTec continues to be the world market share\\nleader in modern wound care products.\\n\\nIn 1995, worldwide sales of medical devices increased 13%.  Excluding the\\nacquisition of Calgon Vestal Laboratories, and a divestiture in 1994, sales\\nincreased 7% as a result of increased sales of knee implants, ostomy and wound\\ncare products.  In 1994, medical device sales increased 6% due to volume growth\\nof prosthetic implants, ostomy and wound care products, offset in part by\\ndeclines in product lines divested in 1994 and 1993.\\n\\nOperating profit margin in the medical devices segment increased to 30.2% in\\n1996 from 27.9% in 1995, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring, due\\nto improved manufacturing efficiencies.  In 1995, operating profit margin of\\n27.9%, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring, decreased from 29.5% in\\n1994.  The decrease in 1995 resulted from increased research and development\\nand sales force expenditures.\\n\\nSales in the Toiletries and Beauty Aids Segment increased 13% in 1996 to $1,753\\nmillion, reflecting a 14% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to pricing\\nand a 3% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Excluding the\\nunfavorable effect of foreign exchange, international sales increased 19% over\\n1995, while domestic sales increased 13%.  The Company\\'s Clairol division\\ncontinued to maintain its market share leadership in the U.S. in haircolorings\\nand is the fastest growing hair care company in the U.S.  Sales of the\\nCompany\\'s haircoloring products were strong, increasing 14%, primarily due to\\nthe continued success of NATURAL INSTINCTS*, NICE \\'N EASY*, ULTRESS*, LASTING\\nCOLOR by LOVING CARE* and salon haircolorings and the introduction of CLAIROL\\nHYDRIENCE*, a unique, water-based permanent haircolor.  Introduced in June 1996,\\nCLAIROL HYDRIENCE* is finding growing acceptance in the marketplace and is\\ncontributing to the growth of the haircoloring segment.  Hair care product\\nsales benefited from the strong sales of the HERBAL ESSENCES* complete line of\\nshampoos, conditioners and styling aids and INFUSIUM 23*, as well as the strong\\nperformances from the SYSTEME BIOLAGE* and VAVOOM* hair care lines from Matrix\\nEssentials.  The Company\\'s skin care products, primarily the SEA BREEZE* and\\nKERI* skin care lines, and the BAN* line of anti-perspirants and deodorants,\\nalso contributed to the segment\\'s volume growth.\\n\\nIn 1995, sales in the toiletries and beauty aids segment increased 21%.\\nExcluding the acquisition of Matrix Essentials in 1994, sales increased 10%,\\nprimarily due to increased sales of haircoloring, hair and skin care products,\\nanti-perspirants and deodorants.  In 1994, sales in the segment increased 4%,\\nprimarily due to increased sales of haircoloring, hair and skin care products,\\npartially offset by decreases in anti-perspirant and deodorant sales and the\\n1993 divestiture of the Clairol beauty appliance business.\\n\\nOperating profit margin in 1996 was 13.7% compared to 10.7% in 1995, excluding\\nthe 1995 provision for restructuring.  The 1996 increase is primarily due to\\n\\n                                    -  24  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nincreased gross margins.  Operating profit margin, excluding the 1995 provision\\nfor restructuring, in 1995 was 10.7%, compared with 13.1% in 1994, due to\\nhigher costs of new product introductions and high costs from acquired\\nbusinesses.\\n\\nGeographic Areas\\n\\nSales in the U.S., net of inter-area sales, increased 10% in 1996, primarily\\ndue to anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs from the pharmaceutical segment,\\ninfant formulas from the nonprescription health segment and haircoloring and\\nhair care products from the toiletries and beauty aids segment.  Strong sales\\nincreases were achieved despite a 68% decline in sales of CAPOTEN*.  Excluding\\nthe sales of CAPOTEN*, U.S. sales increased 16% compared to 1995.  Operating\\nprofit margin was 27.8% in 1996 and 28.4% in 1995, excluding the 1995 provision\\nfor restructuring, primarily due to increased advertising and promotion\\nexpenses.  In 1995, sales in the U.S. increased 10% due to strong sales in the\\npharmaceutical and nonprescription health segments, as well as introductory\\nsales of products from every segment.  Excluding the 1995 provision for\\nrestructuring, operating profit margin decreased to 28.4% in 1995 from 30.1%\\nin 1994, primarily as a result of lower gross margins on WIC sales and\\nincreased advertising and promotion expenditures for new and existing products.\\n\\nInternational sales increased 9% in 1996 and 22% in 1995.  Excluding the effect\\nof foreign exchange rate fluctuations, international sales in 1996 and 1995\\nincreased 13% and 19%, respectively.\\n\\nSales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area sales, increased 8% due\\nto strong sales growth of products from the pharmaceutical segment including\\nanti-cancer and antiretroviral drugs, which were partially offset by decreases\\nin sales of CAPOTEN* and penicillins and from the medical devices segment,\\nincluding ostomy and wound care products.  In the nonprescription health\\nsegment, sales of PLUSSSZ*, vitamins from the 1996 acquisition of Pharmavit, and\\nanalgesic products from the UPSA Group, contributed to sales growth in the\\nregion.  The operating profit margin was 25.4% in 1996, a slight decrease from\\n25.6% in 1995, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring.  In 1995, sales\\nin Europe, Mid-East and Africa increased 30%, primarily due to increased sales\\nof cardiovascular, anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs, and ostomy and wound\\ncare products.  Sales from the UPSA acquisition also contributed to sales\\ngrowth in the region.  Excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring,\\noperating profit margin increased to 25.6% in 1995 from 21.5% in 1994,\\nprimarily as a result of higher utilization of manufacturing facilities in\\nlower tax rate jurisdictions.\\n\\nSales in Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 19% in 1996, due to\\nincreased sales of products from the pharmaceutical segment, including\\ncardiovascular, anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs; from the nonprescription\\nhealth segment, including infant formulas; and from the toiletries and beauty\\naids segments, including haircoloring and hair care products.  Sales of\\npharmaceutical products from the 1996 acquisition of Argentia SA also\\ncontributed to sales growth in the region.  Operating profit margin decreased\\nto 14.8% from 15.2% in 1995, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring.\\nIn 1995, sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries, net of inter-area sales,\\nincreased 5% due to strong sales of anti-cancer and cardiovascular drugs,\\nSERZONE* and ostomy products, offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign\\nexchange rate fluctuations.  Excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring,\\noperating profit margin decreased to 15.2% in 1995 from 20.5% in 1994,\\nprimarily as a result of lower foreign exchange gains.\\n\\n\\n                                    -  25  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nSales in the Pacific region, net of inter-area sales, increased 2% in 1996.\\nExcluding the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange, sales increased 10% as\\na result of increased sales from the nonprescription health segment including\\nanalgesics, infant formulas, school-age nutritional beverages and skin care\\nproduct lines and from the pharmaceutical segment, products including anti-\\ninfective and cardiovascular drugs.  Operating profit margin was 8.6% in 1996\\ncompared to 10.8% in 1995, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring,\\nprimarily as a result of increases in advertising and promotion expenditures\\nin support of new and existing products and increased research and development\\nspending.  In 1995, sales in the Pacific region, net of inter-area sales,\\nincreased 16% as a result of increased sales of analgesics, infant formulas,\\nanti-infectives, cardiovascular drugs and skin care products.  Operating profit\\nmargin was 10.8% in 1995, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring,\\ncompared to 13.6% in 1994 due to increases in advertising and promotion\\nexpenditures in support of new product launches.\\n\\nFinancial Position\\n\\nThe Company considers cash, time deposits and marketable securities as its\\nprincipal measures of liquidity.  These items totaled $2.2 billion at December\\n31, 1996, compared to $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 1995 and\\n1994, respectively.  Working capital levels remain high at $2.5 billion at\\nDecember 31, 1996, compared to $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31,\\n1995 and 1994, respectively.  Cash, time deposits and marketable securities and\\nthe conversion of other working capital items are expected to fund near-term\\noperations of the Company.\\n\\nIn November 1996, the Company issued $350 million principal amount of 6.80%\\nDebentures due November 15, 2026.  Proceeds from the sale of these securities\\nwill be used for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital,\\ncapital expenditures, stock repurchase programs, repayment or refinancing of\\nborrowings and acquisitions.\\n\\nIn order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company engages\\nin hedging activities.  The impact of such hedges on the Company\\'s results of\\noperations and on its financial position is explained further in the notes to\\nthe financial statements.\\n\\nInternally generated cash provided by operations increased to $2.6 billion in\\n1996 from $2.5 billion in 1995 and $2.3 billion in 1994.  Cash provided by\\noperations continued to be the Company\\'s primary source of funds to finance\\noperating needs and expenditures for new plant and equipment.  As part of the\\nCompany\\'s ongoing commitment to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior\\nresearch facilities, the Company has invested over $1.7 billion in capital\\nexpansion over the past three years.\\n\\nCash provided by operations was also used to pay dividends of nearly $4.5\\nbillion over the past three years, to fund acquisitions and to finance the\\nshare repurchase program.  The Company\\'s share repurchase program authorizes\\nthe purchase of common stock from time to time in the open market or through\\nprivate transactions as market conditions permit.  During the past three years,\\nthe Company has repurchased 51 million shares at a cost of $1.8 billion.\\n\\nDuring 1996, the Company made a number of external investments to extend sales\\nand earnings growth and increase its global reach.

At December 31, 1996, a total of 1,261,112 shares were\\noutstanding under the plan.\\n\\nThe Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting\\nfor Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting\\nfor its plans.  Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized\\nfor its stock-based compensation plans other than for restricted stock and\\nperformance-based awards.  Had compensation cost for the Company\\'s other\\nstock option plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant\\ndate for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology\\nprescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,\\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company\\'s net income and\\nearnings per share would have been reduced by approximately $55 million,\\nor $.05 per share in 1996 and $35 million, or $.03 per share in 1995.

Increasing the assumed medical care cost trend rates by 1\\npercentage point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement\\nbenefit obligation as of December 31, 1996 by $25 million and the aggregate\\nof the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit\\nexpense for the year then ended by $2 million.  The weighted-average\\ndiscount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit\\nobligation was 7.8% in 1996, 7.3% in 1995 and 8.8% in 1994.\\n\\nPlan assets principally consist of equity securities and fixed income\\nsecurities.

The most significant of these are described below.\\n\\nBreast Implant Litigation\\n- -------------------------\\n\\nAs of December 31, 1996, approximately 22,000 plaintiffs had filed suit\\nagainst the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC),\\nand certain other subsidiaries, in federal and state courts and in certain\\nCanadian provincial courts, alleging damages for personal injuries of\\nvarious types resulting from polyurethane covered breast implants and smooth\\nwalled breast implants.  The Company, MEC and certain other defendants are\\nparticipants in a settlement program originally approved on September 1,\\n1994, and revised on December 22, 1995, by the Federal District Court in\\nBirmingham, Alabama.  A number, yet unknown, of these plaintiffs have\\nparticipated or are expected to participate in the revised settlement, and\\nthereby discontinue their lawsuits.  Separate class action settlements have\\nbeen approved in the provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec, and an\\nagreement has been reached under which other foreign breast implant\\nrecipients may settle their claims.  Approximately 7,100 domestic class\\nmembers with implants of all manufacturers, including manufacturers not\\nparticipating in the revised settlement, opted out of the class action\\nsettlement approved in 1994.  Of this group, the Company has identified\\napproximately 2,300 domestic opt-outs with active claims based upon alleged\\nMEC implants.  In connection with the revised settlement, the claims office\\nreports that, as of December 16, 1996, over 122,000 registered class members\\nhave submitted proof of manufacturer documentation.  The claims office also\\nreports that, as of December 16, 1996, over 52,000 of these registrants had\\nbeen sent Notification of Status letters advising them of their status in\\nthe settlement.  Of recipients of such letters, over 35,000 have proved that\\nthey have an implant of one of three settling defendants (or their\\nsubsidiaries or predecessor companies) and have chosen to participate in the\\nsettlement, while approximately 3,300 opted out.  The decisions of the\\n\\n\\n                                    -  49  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                       BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n                          (dollars in millions)\\n\\nremaining recipients of Notification of Status letters were not reported as\\nof December 31, 1996.  The claims office also reports that approximately\\n8,000 domestic class members (with implants of all manufacturers) opted out\\nafter receiving the initial notice of the revised settlement in early 1996.\\nBecause the opt-out period has not expired for most class members, and\\nbecause our information is incomplete, it is not possible at this time to\\nestimate with any reasonable precision the total number of women who will\\nopt out of the revised settlement.\\n\\nThe cost of the settlement is dependent upon complex and varying factors,\\nincluding the number of class members that participate in the settlement,\\nthe kinds of claims approved and their dollar value.  The cost to the\\ncompany of resolving opt-out claims is also subject to a number of complex\\nuncertainties in addition to the unknown quantity and quality of such\\nclaims.  In connection with breast implant product liability claims, the\\ncompany recorded special charges in 1993 of $500 million before taxes, $310\\nmillion after taxes, or $.30 per share, in 1994 of $750 million before\\ntaxes, $488 million after taxes, or $.48 per share, and in 1995 of $950\\nmillion before taxes, $590 million after taxes, or $.58 per share.  The 1993\\nspecial charge consisted of $1.5 billion (recorded as Product Liability),\\noffset by $1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds (recorded as Insurance\\nRecoverable).\\n\\nIn light of the continuing uncertainties attendant to these and other\\nfactors (including insurance recoveries), it is difficult at this time to\\nestimate with any precision the cost of the breast implant product liability\\nclaims to the Company.  An additional future charge to earnings might be\\nrequired as additional information relating to the revised settlement and\\nthe litigation becomes known.\\n\\nOther Actions\\n- -------------\\n\\nThe Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are or have been defendants\\nin a number of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of\\npurported statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula\\nproducts and by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and\\nMississippi, alleging a price fixing conspiracy and other violations of\\nstate antitrust or deceptive trade practice laws and seeking penalties and\\nother relief.  On June 7, 1996, the Company reached a settlement covering\\nall the then pending infant formula indirect purchaser cases except the case\\nin Massachusetts and the case brought by the Louisiana Attorney General.\\nOn September 29, 1996, a federal district court in Tallahassee, Florida,\\nentered an order in favor of the defendants, effectively dismissing the\\nLouisiana Attorney General action.  No appeal was taken from that decision.\\nIn December 1996, the company entered an agreement in principle to settle\\nthe Massachusetts action.  Final court approval of the above settlements has\\nbeen granted in every case except those pending in Louisiana, Massachusetts,\\nMichigan and Nevada.  In Louisiana on January 21, 1997, the court entered\\nan order disapproving the settlement.  In the other jurisdictions, joint\\nmotions for final approval of the settlement have either not yet been filed\\n(Massachusetts) or not yet been ruled upon (Michigan and Nevada).\\n\\n                                    -  50  -\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                       BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n                          (dollars in millions)\\n\\nAs of December 31, 1996, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions\\nbrought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical\\nmanufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various\\nfederal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains and\\nindependent drugstores, suing either individually or as representatives of\\na nationwide class of retail pharmacies that has been certified.  These\\ncases, which have been coordinated for pretrial purposes, all seek treble\\ndamages and injunctive relief on account of alleged antitrust violations in\\nthe pricing and marketing of brand name prescription drugs.  Plaintiffs in\\nthe class action have indicated that they intend to claim damages, before\\ntrebling, ranging from 5% to approximately 20% of the value of their\\npurchases of brand name prescription drugs from defendants since October 15,\\n1989.  It is estimated that the class represents approximately two-thirds\\nof retail pharmacy purchases of brand name prescription drugs during the\\nalleged damages period.  The Company, without admitting any wrongdoing,\\nreached an amended agreement as of May 1, 1996, to settle the class action.\\nThe settlement, as amended, has been approved by the court, and purported\\nappeals from that approval are pending.

The Stock Option\\nAgreement shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock subject  to\\nthe Agreement. If the option is an Associated Option, the number of\\nshares of Common Stock subject to such Associated Option shall initially\\nbe equal to the number of performance units or performance  shares\\nsubject  to the award, but one share of Common Stock shall be canceled\\nfor each performance unit or performance share paid out under the award.\\n\\n   (2) Option  Price. The purchase price per share of Common Stock\\npurchasable under an option will be determined by the Committee but will\\nbe not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the\\ndate of the grant of such option.\\n\\n   (3)  Option Period.

An option may  be exercised in whole or in\\npart from time to  time during the option  period (or, if determined  by\\nthe  Committee, in specified  installments during the  option period) by\\ngiving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the  number\\nof  shares to be purchased, such notice  to be accompanied by payment in\\nfull of the purchase price and Withholding Taxes (as defined in  Section\\n11  hereof), unless an election to defer receipt of shares is made under\\nSection 12, due either by certified or bank check, or in shares of Common\\nStock of the Company owned by the optionee having a Fair Market Value at\\nthe date of exercise equal to such purchase price, or in a combination\\nof the foregoing; provided, however, that payment in shares of Common\\nStock of the Company will not be permitted unless at least 100 shares of\\nCommon Stock are required and delivered for such purpose. No shares\\nshall be issued until full payment therefor has been made. An  optionee\\nshall have the rights of a stockholder only with respect to shares of\\nstock for which certificates have been issued to the optionee.\\n\\n                                    E - 4 - 4\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n   (6)  Nontransferability of Options.

Notwithstanding  the\\nforegoing, the Committee may set forth in a Stock Option Agreement at\\nthe time of grant or thereafter, that the options (other than  Incentive\\nStock Options) may be transferred to members of the optionee's immediate\\nfamily,  to trusts  solely for the benefit of such immediate family\\nmembers and to partnerships in which such family members and/or  trusts\\nare  the only  partners. For this purpose, immediate family  means the\\noptionee's spouse,  parents, children,  stepchildren, grandchildren  and\\nlegal dependants. Any transfer of options made under this provision will\\nnot be effective until notice of  such transfer  is delivered  to the\\nCompany.\\n\\n(7) Retirement and Termination of Employment Other than by Death or\\nDisability. If an optionee shall cease to be employed by the Company  or\\nany of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any reason (other than\\ntermination of employment by reason of death or Disability) after the\\noptionee shall have been continuously so employed for one year after the\\ngranting of the option, the option shall be exercisable only to the\\nextent that the optionee was otherwise entitled to exercise it at the\\ntime of such cessation of employment with the Company, Subsidiary or\\nAffiliate, but in no event after the expiration of the option period set\\nforth therein except that in the case of cessation of employment other\\nthan by reason of Retirement or death, the option shall in no event be\\nexercisable after the date three months next succeeding such cessation\\nof employment. The Plan does not confer upon any optionee any right with\\nrespect to continuation of employment by the Company or any of its\\nSubsidiaries or Affiliates.\\n\\n   (8)  Disability of Optionee. An  optionee who ceases to be employed\\nby reason of Disability shall be treated as though the optionee remained\\nin the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate until the\\nearlier of (i) cessation of payments under a disability pay plan of the\\nCompany, Subsidiary or Affiliate, (ii) the optionee's  death, or (iii)\\nthe optionee's 65th birthday.\\n\\n\\n   (9)  Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of the  optionee\\nwhile  in the  employ of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or\\nAffiliates or within whichever period after Retirement or cessation  of\\nemployment of the optionee specified in subsection (7) or (8) is\\napplicable, and provided the optionee shall have been continuously so\\nemployed for one year after the granting of the option, the option shall\\nbe exercisable by the executors, administrators, legatees or\\ndistributees of the optionee's estate, as  the case may be, at any  time\\nfollowing death but in no event after the expiration of the option\\nperiod set forth therein and only to the extent that the optionee  would\\notherwise  have been entitled  to exercise it if  the optionee were then\\nliving, except  that in  the case of the death  of an optionee after\\nRetirement  or other  cessation of employment, the option shall in no\\nevent be exercisable after the later of (i) the date twelve months next\\nsucceeding  such  death  or  (ii) the last day of the period after\\nRetirement or other cessation of employment of the optionee specified in\\nSection 6(b)(7). In the event any option is exercised by the  executors,\\nadministrators, legatees or distributees of the estate of a deceased\\noptionee, the Company shall be under no obligation to issue stock\\nthereunder unless and until the Company is satisfied that the person or\\n\\n                                    E - 4 - 5\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\npersons exercising the option are the duly appointed legal\\nrepresentatives of the deceased optionee's estate or the proper legatees\\nor distributees thereof.\\n\\n   (10)Long-Term Performance Awards. The Committee may from time to time\\ngrant nonqualified stock options under the Plan in conjunction with and\\nrelated to an award of performance units or performance shares  made\\nunder a Long-Term Performance Award as set forth in Section 7(b)(11). In\\nsuch  event, notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (i) the number\\nof shares to which the Associated Option applies shall initially be\\nequal to the number of performance units or performance shares granted\\nby the award, but such number of shares shall be reduced on a\\none-share-for-one unit or share basis to  the extent that the Committee\\ndetermines pursuant to the terms of the award, to pay to the optionee or\\nthe optionee's beneficiary the performance units or performance  shares\\ngranted pursuant to such award; and (ii) such Associated Option shall be\\ncancelable in the discretion  of the Committee,  without the consent of\\nthe optionee, under the  conditions and to the  extent specified in  the\\naward.\\n\\n   (11) Stock Appreciation Rights. In the  case of any option granted\\nunder the Plan, either at the time of grant or by amendment of  such\\noption at any time after such grant there may be included a stock\\nappreciation right which shall be subject to such terms and  conditions,\\nnot inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee shall impose, including\\nthe following:\\n\\n   (A)  A  stock appreciation right shall be exercisable  to the extent,\\nand only to the extent, that the option in which it is included is at\\nthe time exercisable, and may be exercised within such period only at\\nsuch time or times as may be determined by the Committee;\\n\\n   (B)  A stock  appreciation right shall  entitle the optionee  (or any\\nperson entitled  to act under the provisions of subsection (9) hereof)\\nto  surrender  unexercised the option in  which the stock  appreciation\\nright is included (or any portion of such option) to the Company  and to\\nreceive from the  Company in  exchange therefor that number of  shares\\nhaving  an aggregate  value equal  to (or,  in  the discretion  of the\\nCommittee,  less than) the excess  of the value of one share (provided\\nsuch value does  not exceed such multiple of  the option price per share\\nas may be specified by the Committee) over the option  price per share\\nspecified in  such option times the number of shares called for  by the\\noption, or portion thereof, which is so surrendered. The Committee shall\\nbe entitled to cause the Company to settle its obligation, arising out\\nof the exercise of a  stock appreciation right, by  the payment of cash\\nequal to the aggregate value of the shares the Company would  otherwise\\nbe obligated to deliver or partly by the payment of cash and partly by\\nthe delivery of shares.

No shares shall be issued until full payment therefor has\\nbeen made.  An optionee shall have the rights of a stockholder only with respect\\nto shares of stock for which certificates have been issued to the optionee.\\n\\n     (6)  Nontransferability of Options.  No option or stock appreciation right\\ngranted under the Plan shall be transferable by the optionee otherwise than by\\nwill or by the laws of descent and distribution, and such option or stock\\nappreciation right shall be exercisable, during the optionee\\'s lifetime, only\\nby the optionee.\\n\\n     (7)  Retirement and Termination of Employment Other than by Death or\\nDisability.

The Plan does not confer upon any optionee any right with\\nrespect to continuation of employment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries\\nor Affiliates.\\n\\n     (8)  Disability of Optionee.  An optionee who ceases to be employed by\\nreason of Disability shall be treated as though the optionee remained in the\\nemploy of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate until the earlier of (i)\\ncessation of payments under a disability pay plan of the Company, Subsidiary or\\nAffiliate, (ii) the optionee\\'s death, or (iii) the optionee\\'s 65th birthday.\\n\\n     (9)  Death of Optionee.

The Committee may from time to time\\ngrant nonqualified stock options under the Plan in conjunction with and\\nrelated to an award of performance units made under a Long Term Performance\\nAward as set forth in Section 7(b)(11).  In such event, notwithstanding any\\nother provision hereof, (i) the number of shares to which the Associated Option\\napplies shall initially be equal to the number of performance units granted by\\nthe award, but such number of shares shall be reduced on a one share-for-one\\nunit basis to the extent that the Committee determines pursuant to the terms\\nof the award, to pay to the optionee or the optionee\\'s beneficiary the\\nperformance units granted pursuant to such award; and (ii) such Associated\\nOption shall be cancelable in the discretion of the Committee, without the\\nconsent of the optionee, under the conditions and to the extent specified in\\nthe award.\\n\\n     (11)Stock Appreciation Rights.

The Committee\\n          shall be entitled to cause the Company to settle its obligation,\\n          arising out of the exercise of a stock appreciation right, by the\\n          payment of cash equal to the aggregate value of the shares the Company\\n          would otherwise be obligated to deliver or partly by the payment of\\n          cash and partly by the delivery of shares.  Any such election shall be\\n\\n                                    E - 6 - 5\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n          made within 30 business days after the receipt by the Committee of\\n          written notice of the exercise of the stock appreciation right.  The\\n          value of a share for this purpose shall be the Fair Market Value\\n          thereof on the last business day preceding the date of the election to\\n          exercise the stock appreciation right;\\n\\n          (C)  No fractional shares shall be delivered under this subsection\\n          (11) but in lieu thereof a cash adjustment shall be made;\\n\\n          (D)  If a stock appreciation right included in an option is exercised,\\n          such option shall be deemed to have been exercised to the extent of\\n          the number of shares called for by the option or portion thereof\\n          which is surrendered on exercise of the stock appreciation right and\\n          no new option may be granted covering such shares under this Plan; and\\n\\n          (E)  If an option which includes a stock appreciation right is\\n          exercised, such stock appreciation right shall be deemed to have been\\n          canceled to the extent of the number of shares called for by the\\n          option or portion thereof is exercised and no new stock appreciation\\n          rights may be granted covering such shares under this Plan.\\n\\n     (12)Incentive Stock Options.

Long-term Performance Awards:  Awards under the Plan shall consist of the\\nconditional grant to the participants of a specified number of performance\\nunits.  The conditional grant of a performance unit to a participant will\\nentitle the participant to receive a specified dollar value, variable under\\nconditions specified in the award, if the performance objectives specified in\\nthe award are achieved and the other terms and conditions thereof are satisfied.\\n\\n\\nEach award will be subject to the following terms and conditions:\\n\\n     (a)   Grant of Awards. The Committee shall (1) select the officers and key\\nexecutives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom awards may\\nfrom time to time be granted, (2) determine the number of performance units\\ncovered by each award, (3) determine the terms and conditions of each\\nperformance unit awarded and the award period and performance objectives with\\nrespect to each award, (4) determine the periods during which a participant may\\nrequest the Committee to approve deferred payment of a percentage (50% or 100%)\\nof an award (the \"Deferred Portion\") and the interest or rate of return thereon\\nor the basis on which such interest or rate of return thereon is to be\\ndetermined, (5) determine whether payment with respect to the portion of an\\naward which has not been deferred (the \"Current Portion\") and the payment with\\nrespect to the Deferred Portion of an award shall be made entirely in cash,\\nentirely in Common Stock or partially in cash and partially in Common Stock, (6)\\ndetermine whether the award is to be made independently of or in conjunction\\nwith a nonqualified stock option granted under the Plan, and (7) prescribe the\\nform of the instruments necessary or advisable in the administration of the\\nawards.\\n\\n                                    E - 6 - 6\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n     (b)  Terms and Conditions of Award.  Any award conditionally granting\\nperformance units to a participant shall be evidenced by a Performance Unit\\nAgreement executed by the Company and the participant, in such form as the\\nCommittee shall approve, which Agreement shall contain in substance the\\nfollowing terms and conditions and such additional terms and conditions as the\\nCommittee shall prescribe:\\n\\n     (1)  Number of Performance Units.  The Performance Unit Agreement shall\\nspecify the number of performance units conditionally granted to the\\nparticipant.  If the award has been made in conjunction with the grant of an\\nAssociated Option, the number of performance units granted shall initially be\\nequal to the number of shares which the participant is granted the right to\\npurchase pursuant to the Associated Option, but one performance unit shall be\\ncanceled for each share of the Company\\'s Common Stock purchased upon exercise\\nof the Associated Option or for each stock appreciation right included in such\\noption that has been exercised.\\n\\n     (2)  Value of Performance Units.  The Performance Unit Agreement shall\\nspecify the threshold, target and maximum dollar values of each performance unit\\nand corresponding performance objectives as provided under Section 7(b)(5).\\n\\n     (3)  Award Periods.  For each award, the Committee shall designate an award\\nperiod with a duration to be determined by the Committee in its discretion but\\nin no event less than three calendar years within which specified performance\\nobjectives are to be attained.  There may be several award periods in existence\\nat any one time and the duration of performance objectives may differ from each\\nother.\\n\\n     (4)  Consideration.  Each participant, as consideration for the award of\\nperformance units, shall remain in the continuous employ of the Company or of\\none of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for at least one year after the date of\\nthe making of such award, and no award shall be payable until after the\\ncompletion of such one year of employment by the participant.\\n\\n     (5)  Performance Objectives.  The Committee shall establish performance\\nobjectives with respect to the Company for each award period on the basis of\\nsuch criteria and to accomplish such objectives as the Committee may from time\\nto time determine.  Performance objectives may include objective and subjective\\ncriteria.  During any award period, the Committee may adjust the performance\\nobjectives for such award period as it deems equitable in recognition of unusual\\nor nonrecurring events affecting the Company, changes in applicable tax laws or\\naccounting principles, or such other factors as the Committee may determine.\\n\\n     (6)  Determination and Payment of Performance Units Earned.  As soon as\\npracticable after the end of an award period, the Committee shall determine the\\nextent to which awards have been earned on the basis of the Company\\'s actual\\nperformance in relation to the established performance objectives as set forth\\nin the Performance Unit Agreement.  The Performance Unit Agreement shall specify\\nthat as soon as practicable after the end of each award period, the Committee\\nshall determine whether the conditions of Sections 7(b)(4) and 7(b)(5) hereof\\nhave been met and, if so, shall ascertain the amount payable to the participant\\nin respect of the performance units.  As promptly as practicable after it has\\ndetermined that an amount is payable in respect of an award, the Committee shall\\ncause the Current Portion of such award to be paid to the participant or the\\nparticipant\\'s beneficiaries, as the case may be, in the Committee\\'s discretion,\\neither entirely in cash, entirely in Common Stock or partially in cash and\\npartially in Common Stock.

Twenty-five (25) percent\\nof the basic fee payable to the participant for membership on the Board of\\nDirectors shall be deferred and credited to such participant\\'s deferred\\ncompensation account as Share Units equal to the number of shares of the\\nCompany\\'s common stock which could have been purchased with the amounts\\ndeferred, determined by dividing the dollar value of the amounts deferred\\nby the fair market value of a share of the Company\\'s common share as reported\\nin The Wall Street Journal on the effective date of such deferral until such\\ntime as the participant meets a guideline level of Share Unit or Company\\ncommon stock ownership established by the Executive Compensation Committee of\\nthe Company.  A participant may elect, by filing the appropriate form pursuant\\nto Section 9, to defer receipt for any calendar year of either (1) all of the\\ncompensation payable to the participant for serving on the Board of Directors\\nand any committee thereof, (2) only the basic fee payable to the participant\\nfor membership on the Board of Directors, or (3) any percentage, in excess of\\ntwenty-five percent of the basic fee, specified by the participant of the\\ncompensation payable to the participant specified in clause (1) hereof.\\n\\n                                    E - 8 - 1\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n     Section 5.    Form and Computation of Deferred Amounts.\\n\\n     Effective with respect to amounts deferred after the Effective Date of\\nthe Plan and subject to Section 4, a participant, at the time he elects to\\nparticipate in the Plan, shall elect to have the amounts deferred credited\\nto such participant\\'s deferred compensation account as Treasury Units or Dollar\\nUnits each equal to the number of shares of the Company\\'s common stock which\\ncould have been purchased with the amounts deferred determined by dividing the\\ndollar value of the amounts deferred by the fair market value of a share of the\\nCompany\\'s common share as reported in The Wall Street Journal on the effective\\ndate of such deferral.  Such deferrals shall be allocated to Treasury Units,\\nDollar Units and/or Share Units in increments of 0%, 33 1/3%, 50%, 66 2/3% or\\n100%.  The amount credited to a participant\\'s deferred compensation account\\nas Treasury Units shall be credited with interest at a rate to be set by the\\nExecutive Compensation Committee of the Company in January of each year after\\na review of the six-month United States Treasury bill discount rates for the\\npreceding year.  The amount credited to a participant\\'s deferred compensation\\naccount as Dollar Units shall be credited with interest at a rate to be set\\nby the Executive Compensation Committee in January of each year after a review\\nof investment return on the invested cash of the Company.  Upon payment by\\nthe Company of dividends on its common stock, the amount credited to a\\nparticipant\\'s deferred compensation account as Share Units shall be credited\\nwith an amount equal to the number of Share Units multiplied by a fraction\\nthe numerator of which is the amount of such dividend and the denominator of\\nwhich is the fair market value of a Share of the Company\\'s common stock as\\nreported in The Wall Street Journal on the day such dividend is payable.  The\\namount of Share Units credited to a participant\\'s deferred compensation\\naccount shall be adjusted in the discretion of the Executive Compensation\\nCommittee to take into account a merger, consolidation, reorganization,\\nrecapitalization, stock split or other change in corporate structure of\\ncapitalization affecting the Company\\'s common stock.\\n\\n\\n     Section 6.    Period of Deferral.\\n\\n     Subject to Section 4, a participant may elect to defer receipt of\\ncompensation either (1) until a specified year in the future, (2) until the\\ncessation of the participant\\'s service as a Director or (3) until the end of\\nthe calendar year in which the cessation of the participant\\'s service as a\\nDirector occurs.  If alternative (1) is elected, payment will be made or will\\ncommence within sixty days after the beginning of the year specified; if\\nalternative (2) is elected, payment will be made or will commence within sixty\\ndays after the cessation of the participant\\'s service as a Director; and if\\nalternative (3) is elected, payment will be made or will commence within sixty\\ndays after the end of the calendar year in which the cessation of the\\nparticipant\\'s service as a Director occurs.\\n\\n     Section 7.    Form of Payment.\\n\\n     A participant may elect to receive the compensation deferred under the\\nPlan in either (1) a lump sum in cash or (2) a number of installments in cash,\\nnot more than ten, as specified by the participant.  If installment payments\\nare elected, the amount of each installment shall be equal to the balance in\\nthe participant\\'s deferred compensation account divided by the number of\\ninstallments remaining to be paid (including the installment in question).\\n\\n                                    E - 8 - 2\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\n     Section 8.    Death Prior to Receipt.\\n\\n     A participant may elect that, in the event he or she dies prior to\\nreceipt of any or all of the amounts payable pursuant to this Plan, any\\namounts remaining in the participant\\'s deferred compensation account shall\\nbe paid to the participant\\'s estate in cash in either (1) a lump sum within\\nsixty days following notification to the Company of the participant\\'s death or\\n(2) a number of annual installments, not more than ten, as specified by the\\nparticipant.  If alternative (2) is elected and payment to the participant\\npursuant to clause (2) of Section 7 has not commenced prior to death, the\\ninitial installment payment hereunder shall be made sixty days after\\nnotification to the Company of the participant\\'s death, and the amount of each\\nsuch installment shall be determined as provided in the last sentence of\\nSection 7.  If alternative (2) is elected and payment to the participant\\npursuant to clause (2) of Section 7 had commenced prior to death, the\\ninstallment payments to the participant\\'s estate shall be made at the same time\\nand in the same amount as such payments would have been made to the participant\\nhad he or she survived.  For purposes of this Section 8, any amounts deferred\\nas Share Units shall be converted to Dollar Units by multiplying the number of\\nShare Units credited to a participant\\'s deferred compensation account on the\\ndate of his death by the fair market value of a share of the Company\\'s common\\nstock on such date as reported in The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\n\\n     Section 9.    Time of Election of Deferral.\\n\\n     An election to defer compensation may be made by (i) a nominee for\\nelection as a Director prior to his/her election for the calendar year in\\nwhich he/she is being elected (except that a person elected a Director\\nby the Board of Directors may make an election to defer compensation within 30\\ndays after his/her election as a Director, in which event such election to\\ndefer compensation shall be effective only with respect to compensation paid\\nafter the election to defer compensation is made) and (ii) a person then\\ncurrently serving as a Director for the next succeeding calendar year no later\\nthan the preceding December 31.

Status of Previous Deferrals.\\n\\n     Any deferral election made under the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Amended\\nand Restated Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the \"Prior\\nPlan\") shall be subject to and governed by the terms of the Prior Plan.\\n\\n\\n     Section 11.   Manner of Electing Deferral.\\n\\n     A participant may elect to defer compensation by giving written notice\\nto the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company on a form provided by\\nthe Company, which notice shall include the amount to be deferred, the form\\nin which the amount deferred is to be credited, the period of deferral, the\\nform of payment, including the number of installments, if any.\\n\\n                                    E - 8 - 3\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n        Section 12.

Participant\\'s Rights Unsecured.\\n\\n     The right of any participant to receive future payments under the\\nprovisions of the Plan shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets\\nof the Company.\\n\\n\\n     Section 15.

The Company, through its\\ndivisions and subsidiaries, is a major producer and distributor of\\npharmaceutical products, medical devices, nonprescription health products,\\ntoiletries and beauty aids.  In general, the business of the Company\\'s\\nindustry segments is not seasonal.\\n\\nINDUSTRY SEGMENTS\\n- -----------------\\nReference is made to Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 16\\nSegment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF SEGMENTS\\n- -----------------------\\n\\nPharmaceutical Products:\\n- -----------------------\\nThis segment includes sales of prescription medicines, mainly\\ncardiovascular, anti-infective and anti-cancer drugs, which comprise about\\n40%, 20% and 20%, respectively, of the segment\\'s sales, central nervous\\nsystem drugs and other pharmaceutical products.

Reference is made to Industry Segments in the Management\\'s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\\nItem 7 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.  The Company considers the overall\\nprotection of its patent, trademark and license rights to be of material\\nvalue and acts to protect these rights from infringement.  The Company\\nbelieves that, except for the U.S. patent relating to captopril whose\\nexpiration date was redefined by legislation implementing the GATT treaty\\nto February 1996, no single patent or license is of material importance in\\nrelation to the business as a whole.\\n\\nCOMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS\\n- ---------------------------------------\\nThe markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad\\nbased, heavily competitive and include many competitors.  The principal\\nmeans of competition utilized to market the products of Bristol-Myers\\nSquibb include quality, service, price and product performance.  The\\nproducts of the pharmaceutical products segment and the medical devices\\nsegment are promoted on a national and international basis in medical\\njournals and directly to the medical profession.  Most of the other\\nproducts of Bristol-Myers Squibb are generally advertised and promoted on a\\nnational and international basis through the use of television, radio,\\nprint media, consumer offers, and window and in-store displays.  Bristol-Myers\\nSquibb\\'s products are principally sold to the wholesale and retail\\ntrade both nationally and internationally.  Certain products of the\\npharmaceutical products and medical devices segments are also sold to other\\ndrug manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession.  None of the\\nsegments is dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, such that\\nthe loss of any one or more would have a material adverse effect on the\\nsegment.\\n\\n                                       3\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\\n- ------------------------\\nResearch and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s\\nbusinesses, particularly to the pharmaceutical products segment.\\nManagement continues to place great emphasis on these activities.\\nPharmaceutical research and development is carried out by the\\nBristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute which has major\\nfacilities in Princeton and New Brunswick, New Jersey, Wallingford,\\nConnecticut and Seattle, Washington.  Pharmaceutical research and\\ndevelopment is also carried out at various other facilities in the\\nUnited States and in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the\\nUnited Kingdom.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,199 million in 1995, $1,108 million in\\n1994 and $1,128 million in 1993 on company sponsored research and\\ndevelopment activities.  Pharmaceutical research and development\\nspending, as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 12.9% in 1995\\ncompared to 13.6% in 1994 and 14.9% in 1993.\\n\\nREGULATION\\n- ----------\\nMost aspects of the Company\\'s business are subject to some degree of\\ngovernment regulation in the countries in which its operations are\\nconducted.  The Company\\'s policy is to comply fully with all regulatory\\nrequirements applying to its products and operations.  For some\\nproducts, and in some countries, government regulation is significant\\nand, in general, there is a trend to more stringent regulation.  The\\nCompany devotes significant time, effort and expense addressing the\\nextensive governmental regulatory requirements applicable to its\\nbusiness.  Governmental regulatory actions can result in the recall or\\nseizure of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary\\nfor the production or sale of a product, and other civil and criminal\\nsanctions.\\n\\nIn the United States, the drug, medical device, diagnostic, food and\\ncosmetic industries in which the Company operates have long been subject\\nto regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as\\nto product manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.\\nAssuring compliance with appropriate laws and regulations requires\\nincreasing expenditures of time and resources.\\n\\nIn addition, governmental bodies in the United States as well as other\\ncountries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care\\nand, in some cases, have focused attention on the pricing of drugs and\\non appropriate drug utilization.  Government regulation in these areas\\nalready exists in some countries and may be expanded significantly in\\nthe United States and other countries in the future.\\n\\nWhile the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business\\nmay be affected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its\\nsubstantial experience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements\\nand restrictions on its operations throughout the world and its\\ndevelopment of new and improved products should enable it to compete\\neffectively within this environment.\\n\\nEMPLOYEES\\n- ---------\\nBristol-Myers Squibb employed approximately 49,140 people at December 31, 1995.\\n\\n                                       4\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nDOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS\\n- -------------------------------\\nReference is made to Note 16 Segment Information in the Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this\\nForm 10-K Annual Report.\\n\\nInternational operations are subject to certain risks which are inherent\\nin conducting business abroad, including possible nationalization or\\nexpropriation, price and exchange controls, limitations on foreign\\nparticipation in local enterprises and other restrictive governmental\\nactions.  In addition, changes in the relative value of currencies take\\nplace from time to time and their effects may be favorable or\\nunfavorable on Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s operations.  There are currency\\nrestrictions relating to repatriation of earnings in certain countries.\\n\\nItem 2.   PROPERTIES.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb\\'s world headquarters is located at 345 Park Avenue,\\nNew York, New York, where it leases approximately 841,800 square feet of\\nfloor space, approximately 285,880 square feet of which is sublet to\\nothers.  The Company\\'s pharmaceutical world headquarters is located in\\nPrinceton, New Jersey.  Other major domestic pharmaceutical facilities\\nare located in Evansville, Indiana, New Brunswick and Plainsboro, New\\nJersey and Buffalo and Syracuse, New York.  The Company\\'s major domestic\\nmedical devices facilities are located in Warsaw, Indiana, St. Louis,\\nMissouri, Skillman, New Jersey and Greensboro, North Carolina.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb manufactures products at forty-eight major\\nworldwide locations with an aggregate floor space of approximately\\n13,278,000 square feet.  Forty-six are owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb and\\ntwo facilities are leased.  The U.S. manufacturing facilities total\\neighteen, of which 44% and 28% are used in the manufacture of\\npharmaceutical products and medical devices, respectively.  The non-U.S.\\noperations include a total of thirty  major manufacturing facilities, of\\nwhich 73% and 3% are used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products\\nand medical devices, respectively.  These facilities are located in\\nAustralia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Ireland,\\nIndonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, South\\nAfrica, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Venezuela, and aggregate\\napproximately 6,539,800 square feet of space.\\n\\nPortions of these facilities and other facilities owned or leased by\\nBristol-Myers Squibb in the United States and elsewhere are used for\\nresearch, administration, storage and distribution.  Bristol-Myers\\nSquibb\\'s facilities are well-maintained, adequately insured and in\\nsatisfactory condition.\\n\\nCapital expenditures for the construction, expansion and modernization\\nof production, research and administrative facilities aggregated $517\\nmillion, $577 million and $580 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nItem 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\\n\\nReference is made to Note 17 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K\\nAnnual Report.\\n\\n                                       5\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nBreast Implant Litigation\\n- -------------------------\\nAs of December 31, 1995, approximately 20,000 plaintiffs had filed suit\\nagainst the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation\\n(\"MEC\"), and certain other companies, in federal and state courts and in\\ncertain Canadian provincial courts, alleging damages for personal\\ninjuries of various types resulting from polyurethane covered breast\\nimplants and smooth walled breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC\\nor its predecessors. Most of these plaintiffs are participants in the\\n1994 class action settlement referred to below.  A number of other\\nmanufacturers of breast implants, as well as suppliers of component\\nparts and other parties, are also defendants in many of these cases.\\nThe plaintiffs typically seek compensatory damages for alleged medical\\nconditions and emotional distress as well as punitive damages.  Some of\\nthese women have sued numerous manufacturers without specifying the\\nmanufacturer of the implants involved.\\n\\nIn June 1992, all federal breast implant cases were consolidated for\\npre-trial purposes in the Northern District of Alabama before the\\nHonorable Sam C. Pointer, Jr.  On September 1, 1994, Judge Pointer\\napproved a class action settlement, subject to various conditions,\\ninvolving payments totaling up to approximately $4.25 billion by the\\ndefendants over 30 years.  The Court excluded claimants from Quebec,\\nOntario and Australia from the settlement but allowed voluntary\\nparticipation by such women.  Appeals of the Court\\'s order approving the\\nsettlement were filed, primarily by health insurers, health care\\norganizations and foreign claimants.  These appeals are still pending.\\n\\nThe settlement permitted claimants to elect not to participate (opt out)\\nand, as stated below, over 9,000 foreign and domestic women (as to all\\ndefendants) had elected to opt out of the settlement.  The settlement\\nalso provided, among other things, that if the total dollar value of all\\napproved current disease compensation claims, as defined in the\\nsettlement agreement, exceeded $1.2 billion, scheduled benefits would be\\nreduced and claimants would have a second opportunity to withdraw or opt\\nout of the settlement.  On October 7, 1995, after reviewing a sample of\\nabout 3,000 claims, Judge Pointer issued an order declaring that class\\nmembers in the breast implant class action settlement would be accorded\\nsuch a second opt out right because the value of current claims would\\nlikely far exceed the $1.2 billion set aside for such claims.\\n\\nUnder the October 7 order, class members would be permitted to opt out\\nand pursue litigation beginning on or about December 1, 1995.  The Court\\nstated, however, that class members would not be required to take\\nimmediate action to file suit to preserve their claims, for the class\\naction would be maintained and statutes of limitations would remain\\nsuspended until a class member opts out (subject to any cut-off dates).\\nThe Court also then indicated that a revised settlement program might be\\noffered by the Company, Baxter Healthcare and 3M Company.\\n\\nOn November 13, 1995, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized\\nmanagement to enter into such a revised settlement program.  Baxter\\nHealthcare, 3M Company, McGhan Medical Corporation and Union Carbide\\nCorporation also agreed to participate.  On December 22, 1995, Judge\\nPointer approved the revised settlement.  New appeals have been filed\\nfrom the order approving the revised settlement.\\n\\n                                       6\\n<PAGE>\\nThe fifteen-year revised settlement program generally provides benefits\\nto those breast implant recipients, other than foreign claimants, who\\nhave had at least one breast implant manufactured by one of the settling\\ndefendants (or their predecessors or subsidiaries).  Several kinds of\\nbenefits are available for eligible participants with breast implants\\nmade by companies affiliated with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter and 3M:\\n(1) for current claimants, compensation ranging from $10,000 to $50,000\\nbased on disease and disability definitions of the original settlement,\\nplus supplemental benefits of an additional $15,000 to $50,000 for\\nclaimants with ruptured implants; (2) for current claimants seeking\\nhigher benefits and for other registrants, compensation ranging from\\n$75,000 to $250,000 based on new, more stringent disease and disability\\ndefinitions; and (3) although the settling defendants are not\\nrecommending removal of implants absent some specific medical reason, a\\n$3,000 payment for those class members (other than late registrants) who\\nseek removal of implants.  In addition, current claimants would be\\neligible for an advance payment of $5,000, and other existing\\nregistrants would be eligible for an advance payment of $1,000.  For\\ncertain current claimants, benefits would be payable regardless of the\\nnumber of claimants seeking compensation, regardless of the total dollar\\nvalue of approved claims, and, in many cases, regardless of the outcome\\nof appeals from the order approving the settlement.  For other\\nclaimants, benefits would be subject to annual limits aggregating $755\\nmillion for all participating companies over the fifteen-year life of\\nthe program.  The Company\\'s aggregate limit for such benefits over that\\nperiod is $400 million.  In the event the dollar value of claims subject\\nto the limit exceeds the annual amount, affected claimants may be\\nafforded a new opt out right but without the right to assert punitive or\\nother statutory multiple damage claims.\\n\\nIn January 1996, the settlement notice was mailed to approximately\\n450,000 persons.  In addition to explaining potential class members\\'\\nrights and benefits under the settlement, the notice packet also\\nprovides instructions for class members who may wish to opt out of the\\nsettlement.  Although class members are now permitted to opt out of the\\nsettlement, the Court has cautioned class members against doing so and\\nhas \"strongly recommend[ed]\" that most class members delay any decision\\nabout opting out until they receive a Notification of Status letter from\\nthe claims office.  Class members must then decide whether to\\nparticipate in the settlement or opt out no later than 45 days after\\nthey receive the Notification of Status letter.  Class members who had\\nnot previously registered by certain deadlines will have the opportunity\\nto opt out provided they register by April 1, 1996.  At this time, it is\\nnot possible on any reliable basis to estimate with any precision how\\nmany class members will participate in or opt out of the settlement.\\n\\nThe cost of the settlement is dependent upon complex and varying\\nfactors, including the number of class members that participate in the\\nsettlement, the kinds of claims approved and their dollar value.  In\\nlight of the uncertainties attendant to these and other factors, it is\\nnot possible to achieve any precision at this time in estimating the\\ncost of the settlement to the Company.  The Court has advised that\\napproximately 440,000 women with implants of all manufacturer companies\\nhad registered with the claims office under the original settlement,\\nincluding approximately 57,000 foreign class members.  However, since\\nall women with implants were urged by the Court to register, the number\\nof registrants does not indicate the number of women who have filed or\\nwill file claims against the settlement funds.\\n\\n                                       7\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nIn July of 1995, the Company entered into a $20.5 million (U.S. funds)\\nclass action settlement with plaintiff representatives in the provinces\\nof Ontario and Quebec.  The class includes persons who have or had MEC\\nbreast implants and who reside in Ontario and Quebec or who received\\ntheir MEC implants there.  The settlement has been approved by the\\nprovincial courts of Ontario and Quebec.  The Company has the right to\\nwithdraw from the settlement if the number of persons participating in\\nthe settlement is unacceptably low.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s insurers have been notified of the breast implant claims,\\nthe settlement and revised settlement, and generally have reserved their\\nrights or declined to confirm coverage.  In 1993, the Company commenced\\nlitigation in state court, Jefferson County, Texas, against most of the\\nCompany\\'s insurers, seeking damages and a declaration of coverage.  The\\nCompany has reached settlements with some of its insurers and trial of\\nthis insurance coverage case currently is expected in late 1996.\\n\\nAs of December 1, 1995, 7,115 United States women and 2,140 foreign\\nwomen (excluding those from Australia, Ontario and Quebec) had elected\\nto opt out of the original settlement as to all defendants.  With\\nrespect to such opt outs by women from the United States, and after\\naccounting for settlements and other case dispositions since that time,\\nthe Company now estimates that approximately 2,600 women, a large number\\nof whom reside in Texas, may have remaining claims based upon MEC\\nimplants.  The Company has, at this time, identified approximately 300\\nof the foreign opt outs as having MEC implants.  A number of the opt\\nouts cannot, at this time, be identified as having implants of any\\nparticular manufacturer, although it is expected that such manufacturer\\nidentification will ultimately be possible in most cases.  In addition,\\nas indicated above, it is not possible at this time to estimate the\\nnumber of women who will opt out of the revised settlement so that the\\nexact number of lawsuits that will remain outstanding against the\\nCompany with respect to breast implant litigation cannot be determined\\nat this time.\\n\\nThe cost to the Company of resolving opt out claims is subject to a\\nnumber of complex uncertainties in addition to the unknown quantity and\\nquality of such claims.  While there have been some large judgments, the\\nrelatively few trials against breast implant manufacturers have produced\\nmixed results and additional trials may affect the outlook.  The Company\\nexpects to try a number of breast implant cases in various states in\\n1996.  It has maintained throughout this litigation that breast implants\\ndo not cause disease and recent medical and scientific data support the\\nCompany\\'s position.  The results of continuing medical research and a\\nvariety of additional factors, including the success of other legal\\ndefenses and the success of the revised settlement program, may\\nsubstantially affect the cost of resolving opt out cases.\\n\\nIn 1993, the Company recorded a special charge of $500 million before\\ntaxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant product\\nliability claims.  The charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential\\nliabilities and expenses, offset by $1 billion of expected insurance\\nproceeds.  In 1994, the Company recorded an additional special charge of\\n$750 million before taxes ($488 million after taxes) in respect of\\nbreast implant product liability claims.  In the fourth quarter of 1995,\\nthe Company recorded an additional special charge in respect of such\\nclaims.  The 1995 charge consisted of $950 million before taxes, $590\\nmillion after taxes, or $1.17 per share.  Since so much information\\n\\n                                       8\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nabout these claims is not yet known, predictions about the existence or\\namount of any future charges cannot be definitely made at this time; it\\ncan only be said that an additional charge may be required as additional\\ninformation relating to the revised settlement and the litigation\\nbecomes known and that, while any such charge could have a material\\nadverse effect on the results of operations in the period in which\\ntaken, the Company does not believe that such a charge would have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on its liquidity or its consolidated financial\\nposition.\\n\\nInfant Formula Matters\\n- ----------------------\\nThe Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are defendants in a\\nnumber of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of\\npurported statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula\\nproducts and by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and\\nMississippi, alleging a price fixing conspiracy and other violations of\\nstate antitrust or deceptive trade practices laws and seeking damages\\nand/or penalties and other relief.  On December 6, 1995, a trial in\\nstate court in Wichita, Kansas in which the Company and Abbott\\nLaboratories were defendants concluded with a jury verdict in favor of\\nthe defendants.  This case in Kansas was the first infant formula\\nindirect purchaser case to go to trial.  The court subsequently denied\\nthe plaintiff\\'s motion for a new trial.  Courts in Colorado, Florida,\\nKentucky, Nevada, North Carolina and Tennessee have dismissed similar\\ncomplaints, and the plaintiffs have appealed or are expected to appeal\\nthose dismissals.  On June 29, 1995, the Texas Supreme Court handed down\\na decision in the Company\\'s favor, holding that the plaintiffs, as\\nindirect purchasers, were barred from proceeding under the Texas\\nDeceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act.  The Company\\nsubsequently settled a separate action brought by the Texas Attorney\\nGeneral.  Motions to certify classes of indirect purchasers of infant\\nformula have been denied in Minnesota, in Michigan and by two courts in\\nAlabama, and have been granted in Wisconsin and South Dakota.  A trial\\ndate of June 10, 1996 has been set in the Wisconsin case.  The Canadian\\nBureau of Competition Policy has discontinued its inquiries into alleged\\nanticompetitive practices by the Company and certain other members of\\nthe Canadian infant formula industry.  The Competition Law Enforcement\\nAuthority in France, the Conseil de la Concurrence, has brought a\\ncomplaint against seven infant formula companies (including\\nBristol-Myers Squibb SA) and five food outlet chains alleging violations\\nby manufacturers in obtaining infant milk rotations from hospitals and\\nagainst both manufacturers and retailers for allegedly engaging in\\nresale price maintenance of infant formula.  The Company is in the\\nprocess of responding to these allegations.  The Company believes that\\nthese actions are without merit and that their ultimate disposition will\\nnot have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s results of\\noperations, liquidity or consolidated financial position.\\n\\nPharmaceutical Pricing Litigation\\n- ---------------------------------\\nAs of December 31, 1995, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions\\nbrought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical\\nmanufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various\\nfederal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains\\nand independent drugstores, suing either individually or as a\\nrepresentative of a nationwide class of retail pharmacies that has been\\ncertified.  These cases, which have been coordinated for pretrial\\npurposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District\\n\\n                                       9\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nof Illinois, all seek treble damages and injunctive relief on account of\\nan alleged antitrust conspiracy concerning the pricing and marketing of\\nbrand name prescription drugs; the plaintiffs who are suing individually\\nare also asserting claims of unlawful price discrimination under the\\nRobinson-Patman Act.  Discovery has been completed with respect to\\nclaims concerning the alleged antitrust conspiracy.  Completion of\\nadditional discovery with respect to Robinson-Patman Act claims against\\nthe Company has been stayed.  None of the plaintiffs has specified the\\namount of damages claimed, but plaintiffs in the class action have\\nindicated that they intend to claim damages, before trebling, ranging\\nfrom 5% to approximately 20% of the value of their purchases of brand\\nname prescription drugs from defendants since October 15, 1989.  It is\\nestimated that the class members who have not opted out represent\\napproximately two-thirds of retail pharmacy purchases of brand name\\nprescription drugs during the alleged damages period.  As of January 31,\\n1996, the Company, without admitting any wrongdoing, reached an\\nagreement, which is subject to approval by the Court, to settle the\\nclass action for payments by the Company over three years totaling $33.9\\nmillion.  The settlement involved twelve other defendants as well and\\nwas preliminarily approved by the Court on February 15, 1996.  A hearing\\nconcerning final approval is scheduled for March 27, 1996.  Federal\\ncases brought by retail pharmacies that have opted out of the class\\nremain pending, and the Company has moved for summary judgment with\\nrespect to the conspiracy claims asserted in those actions.  Class\\naction cases brought by retail pharmacies in state courts against a\\nsimilar group of defendants and alleging similar grounds under state law\\nare proceeding in California, Alabama, Wisconsin and Minnesota.  The\\nCalifornia court has certified a class of California retail pharmacies.\\nClass action cases brought by consumers in state courts against a\\nsimilar group of defendants and alleging similar grounds under state law\\nhave been brought in California, Washington, Colorado, New York,\\nArizona, Maine, Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, the District of Columbia\\nand Wisconsin.   The California court has certified a class of\\nCalifornia consumers.  The Alabama court has purported to certify a\\nclass consisting of consumers in Alabama and other states, including the\\nDistrict of Columbia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,\\nNew Mexico and Wisconsin.  The consumer actions brought in Washington\\nand Colorado have been dismissed; an appeal is pending in the Washington\\naction.  The Company believes that these actions are without merit and\\nthat their ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect\\non the Company\\'s results of operations, liquidity or consolidated\\nfinancial position.\\n\\nEnvironmental Matters\\n- ---------------------\\nThe Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved\\nin, a number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection\\nAgency or comparable state agencies under the Comprehensive\\nEnvironmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or\\nSuperfund) or comparable state laws directed at the cleanup of hazardous\\nwaste sites.  While it is not possible to predict with certainty the\\noutcome of these cases, the Company believes that the ultimate\\ndisposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on\\nthe Company\\'s operating results, liquidity or consolidated financial\\nposition.\\n\\nItem 4.

Domestic sales increased 10% to\\n$7.7 billion, while international sales increased 22% to $6.1 billion.\\nExchange rate fluctuations had a favorable effect of 1% on worldwide\\nsales and 3% on international sales.\\n\\nEarnings before income taxes, excluding the 1995 and 1994 special\\ncharges and the 1995 provision for restructuring, increased 11% to\\n$3,662 million in 1995, as net earnings increased 12% to $2,600 million\\nand earnings per share increased 12% to $5.14 from $4.58 in 1994.\\nIncluding these charges, earnings before income taxes were $2,402\\nmillion in 1995 and $2,555 million in 1994, net earnings were $1,812\\nmillion in 1995 and $1,842 million in 1994, and earnings per share were\\n$3.58 in 1995 and $3.62 in 1994.\\n\\nDuring the past two years, the Company has broadened and enhanced its\\nproduct lines with a number of strategic acquisitions and\\ncollaborations.  In 1994, the Company acquired the remaining interest in\\nthe UPSA Group, the leading maker and marketer of analgesics in France\\nand Belgium, acquired Matrix Essentials, Inc., the leading manufacturer\\nin North America of professional hair care products for beauty salons,\\nand acquired an equity interest in Azupharma GmbH, one of Germany\\'s\\nmajor generic pharmaceutical companies.  In 1995, the Company acquired\\nCalgon Vestal Laboratories, a wound and skin care and infection control\\nproducts business, and A/S GEA Farmaceutisk Fabrik, a leading\\nmanufacturer and marketer of branded generic pharmaceuticals for the\\nScandinavian market.  During 1995, the Company announced research\\nalliances and biotechnology collaborations, which are described later in\\nthe research and development discussion.  In January 1996, the Company\\nacquired control of Pharmavit Gyogyszer-es Elelmiszeripari Reszvenytarsasag,\\none of Hungary\\'s leading manufacturers of over-the-counter medicines,\\nnutritional products and generic pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nIn addition to its strong product lines, the Company continues to\\nbenefit from its strong financial position.  At December 31, 1995, the\\nCompany held $2.2 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable\\nsecurities.  Cash provided by operating activities, which totaled $2.5\\nbillion in 1995, continued as the primary source of financing Company\\ngrowth, research, new product development and introductions, capital\\nspending and working capital needs.  It also was used to pay dividends\\nof nearly $1.5 billion in 1995.  Dividends per common share were $2.96\\nin 1995, increasing from $2.92 per share paid in 1994.  An additional\\ndividend increase was announced in December 1995.  The 1996 indicated\\nannual payment of $3.00 per share represents the twenty-fourth\\nconsecutive year that the Company has raised the dividend on its common\\nstock.  With this 1996 annual payment, Bristol-Myers Squibb dividends\\nwill have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 11% over the\\npast 10 years.  Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s strong financial position is\\nevidenced by its triple A credit rating from both Moody\\'s and Standard &\\nPoor\\'s, making Bristol-Myers Squibb one of only nine U.S. companies with\\nthis distinction.  The Company as a result, has substantial unused\\nborrowing capacity by which it can pursue its objectives.\\n\\n                                      18\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nNET SALES AND EARNINGS\\n- ----------------------\\nWorldwide sales increased 15% in 1995 to $13.8 billion, compared to\\nincreases of 5% and 2% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Volume growth\\nwas the primary contributor to the increase in sales in 1995, with price\\nincreases having minimal impact.  Price increases and the favorable\\neffect of exchange rate fluctuations each contributed 1% to sales growth\\non a worldwide basis.  Price increases had no impact on domestic sales\\ngrowth in 1995.  In 1994, the 5% increase in sales reflected a 4%\\nincrease due to volume and a 1% increase due to price increases.\\nExchange rate fluctuations had no attributable effect on total Company\\nsales growth.  Domestic sales increased 10% in 1995 and 4% in both 1994\\nand 1993, while international sales increased 22% in 1995, 7% in 1994\\nand remained at prior year levels in 1993.\\n\\nAs described in Notes 2 and 17 to the financial statements, the Company\\npreviously reported its agreement to settle pending and future breast\\nimplant product liability claims (related to a previously discontinued\\nbusiness of a subsidiary) brought against it, its Medical Engineering\\nCorporation subsidiary, and certain other subsidiaries.  In the fourth\\nquarter of 1995, the Company recorded a special charge to earnings of\\n$950 million before taxes, $590 million after taxes, or $1.17 per share.\\nThe 1995 special charge is in addition to a charge of $750 million\\nbefore taxes, $488 million after taxes, or $.96 per share, recorded in\\nthe fourth quarter of 1994 and a charge of $500 million before taxes\\n($1.5 billion of liability offset by expected insurance proceeds of $1.0\\nbillion), $310 million after taxes, or $.60 per share, recorded in the\\nfourth quarter of 1993.\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company recorded a provision for\\nrestructuring of $310 million before taxes, $198 million after taxes, or\\n$.39 per share.  The provision primarily relates to the consolidation of\\nplants and facilities, and related employee termination costs.\\n\\nAs a result of the special charges and the provision for restructuring,\\nnet earnings were $1,812 million, or $3.58 per share, in 1995, $1,842\\nmillion, or $3.62 per share, in 1994 and $1,959 million, or $3.80 per\\nshare, in 1993.  Excluding the special charges and the 1995 provision\\nfor restructuring, net earnings were $2,600 million, or $5.14 per share,\\nin 1995, $2,330 million, or $4.58 per share, in 1994 and $2,269 million,\\nor $4.40 per share, in 1993.\\n\\nThe effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 24.6%\\nin 1995 compared with 27.9% and 23.8% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.\\nExcluding the special charges and the provision for restructuring, the\\neffective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 29.0% in\\n1995, 29.5% in 1994 and 26.1% in 1993.  The 1995 effective income tax\\nrate, a decrease of 0.5% from 1994, resulted from higher levels of\\nincome from lower tax jurisdictions.  The increase in the 1994 effective\\nincome tax rate to 29.5% from 26.1% in 1993 resulted from the\\ncurtailment of certain tax benefits from Puerto Rico operations, enacted\\nin the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.\\n\\n                                      19\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nEXPENSES\\n- --------\\nTotal costs and expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding the special\\ncharges and the provision for restructuring, were 73.4% in 1995,\\ncompared with 72.4% in 1994 and 73.1% in 1993.  The increase in 1995\\nprimarily resulted from increased advertising and promotion expenditures\\nin the nonprescription health products and toiletries and beauty aids\\nsegments.  In addition, due to the Company\\'s increased participation in\\nthe federal government\\'s Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program,\\ngross margins in the nonprescription health products segment were lower\\nthan the prior year.  The decrease in 1994 primarily resulted from\\nreductions in selling expenses, improvements in gross margin and the\\ndivestiture of businesses with higher costs.\\n\\nCost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, increased to 26.4% in\\n1995 from 26.1% in 1994.  The increase in 1995 is due to increased\\nparticipation in the WIC program and lower gross margins in connection\\nwith recent acquisitions.  These increases were partially offset by a\\nfavorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies.  In 1994,\\ncost of products sold decreased as a percentage of sales from 26.5% in\\n1993 to 26.1% due to a favorable product mix and the divestiture of\\nbusinesses with higher cost of sales.\\n\\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of\\nsales, were 26.7% in 1995 compared to 26.4% in 1994 and 27.1% in 1993.\\n\\nAdvertising and promotion expenses in support of new and existing\\nproducts increased to $1,646 million in 1995 from $1,367 million in\\n1994, primarily due to spending in support of new product launches.  In\\n1994, advertising and promotion expenses increased from 1993 levels\\nprimarily as a result of increases in the toiletries and beauty aids\\nsegment, with the addition of Matrix Essentials, Inc., and in the\\npharmaceutical products segment, in preparation for the launches of new\\nproducts.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s investment in research and development totaled $1,199\\nmillion in 1995, an increase of 8% over 1994.  The higher level of\\nspending reflects the Company\\'s continued commitment to research over a\\nbroad range of therapeutic areas and to clinical development in support\\nof new products.  Over the last 10 years, research and development\\nexpenses increased at a compound annual rate of 11%.  In 1995, research\\nand development spending dedicated to the discovery and development of\\npharmaceutical products was 12.9% of pharmaceutical sales compared to\\n13.6% and 14.9% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  During 1995, the\\nCompany announced research alliances and biotechnology collaborations\\nwith the following companies: SEQ LTD, for ultra-high speed DNA\\nsequencing; Genzyme Transgenics, for the production of antibodies from\\ngoats\\' milk; Phyton, Inc., for an option to license plant cell culture\\nfor the production of TAXOL(R)*(paclitaxel); and Spec/Biospecs, for\\naccess to its libraries of novel organic chemicals.  The Company entered\\ninto a licensing arrangement with Taiho of Japan to develop and market\\nUFT (tegafur and uracil), an oral anti-tumor agent which may have fewer\\ndebilitating side effects than current therapy.  The Company made equity\\ninvestments in the following companies: Somatix Therapy Corporation, a\\ncompany specializing in gene therapy; SIBIA, Inc., a company developing\\nproducts based on cloned receptor and functional assay technology for\\nAlzheimer\\'s disease treatment; IXSYS, Inc., a company engaged in the\\ndevelopment of tumor antigens and antibodies; and EntreMed, Inc., a\\n\\n                                      20\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nleader in the field of angiogenesis research.  During 1995, an\\nadditional equity investment was made in Cadus Pharmaceutical\\nCorporation, a company that specializes in developing novel drug\\nscreening techniques.  In January 1996, the Company announced a\\ncollaboration with NeuroSearch A/S of Denmark, to develop an oral\\ncompound for the treatment of Parkinson\\'s disease.\\n\\nINDUSTRY SEGMENTS\\n- -----------------\\nAt the end of 1995, Bristol-Myers Squibb had 29 product lines each with\\nmore than $100 million in annual sales, representing products from all\\nfour of its industry segments.  In general, the business of the\\nCompany\\'s industry segments is not seasonal.\\n\\nSales in the Pharmaceutical Products Segment, which represents the\\nlargest segment at 57% of total Company sales, increased 12% in 1995 to\\n$7,810 million.  Volume growth was the primary contributor to this\\nincrease, as price increases and the favorable effect of exchange rate\\nfluctuations each had a 1% effect on the segment\\'s sales growth for the\\nyear.  Domestic and international sales increased 7% and 18%,\\nrespectively.  The Company has a strong and growing cardiovascular\\nproduct franchise.  Sales of cardiovascular drugs, the largest product\\ngroup in the segment at $2.9 billion, increased 6%.  Captopril, an\\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and the Company\\'s largest\\nselling product, is primarily sold under the trademark CAPOTEN*.\\nCaptopril sales remained at prior year levels despite increased\\ncompetition in the ACE inhibitor market in the U.S. and loss of patent\\nexclusivity, primarily in Germany.  In the U.S., the expiration date of\\nthe CAPOTEN* patent was redefined by legislation implementing the GATT\\ntreaty to February 1996.  PRAVACHOL*, the Company\\'s largest selling\\ncholesterol-lowering agent with sales of $770 million, was the largest\\ncontributor to the increase in cardiovascular sales.  In the U.S. and\\nseveral other markets, PRAVACHOL* benefited from expanded labeling\\ndescribing that it reduces by 67% the risk of recurrent myocardial\\ninfarction in patients with elevated cholesterol.  In the fourth quarter\\nof 1995, the results were released from the West of Scotland Coronary\\nPrevention Study, which found that PRAVACHOL* is associated with an\\nearly and sustained reduction of heart attack and death in individuals\\nwith high cholesterol who have never had a heart attack.  MONOPRIL*, a\\nsecond generation ACE inhibitor with once-a-day dosage, performed well,\\nwith strong volume growth in the U.S. and in overseas markets.  The\\nCompany also has a strong presence in the anti-infectives market.  Sales\\nof the Company\\'s anti-infective products increased 12% to $1.7 billion\\ndue to increases in sales of ZERIT*, the Company\\'s newest antiretroviral\\ndrug, cleared for marketing in the U.S. under the FDA\\'s accelerated\\napproval program in June 1994, and which received full FDA approval in\\nJanuary 1996, CEFZIL*, an oral cephalosporin, used in the treatment of\\nrespiratory infections, DURICEF*, an oral cephalosporin, VIDEX*, an\\nantiretroviral drug, and broad spectrum penicillins.  In addition,\\nMAXIPIME*, a fourth generation injectable cephalosporin introduced in\\ninternational markets in 1995 and approved for marketing in the U.S. in\\nearly 1996, contributed to the growth of anti-infectives.  Offsetting\\nthese increases were lower sales of AMIKIN* and AZACTAM* due to\\nincreased generic competition.  Bristol-Myers Squibb remains the leader\\nin the anti-cancer therapeutics category.  Sales of its anti-cancer\\ndrugs increased 20% to $1.6 billion.  Sales of TAXOL* (the exclusivity\\nfor which expires in the U.S. in December 1997), the Company\\'s leading\\nanti-cancer agent, were $580 million in 1995, increasing 68% over the\\n\\n                                      21\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nprior year.  In April 1994, TAXOL* received clearance in the U.S. for\\nuse in the treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination\\nchemotherapy for metastatic disease or after relapse within six months\\nof adjuvant chemotherapy.  In late 1992, TAXOL* was initially cleared in\\nthe U.S. and Canada for treatment of patients with ovarian cancer whose\\nfirst-line or subsequent chemotherapy has failed.  Also in 1995, 1994\\nand 1993, TAXOL* received clearance for marketing in a number of\\ncountries in Europe, Latin America and the Pacific area.  Sales of\\nPARAPLATIN* and PLATINOL* (the patent for which expires in the U.S. in\\nDecember 1996), also increased due to their use in combination therapy\\nwith TAXOL*.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in\\nsales of VEPESID* (the exclusivity for which expired in the U.S. in\\nNovember 1993).  The Company has a growing position in the central\\nnervous system drug category.  Sales of central nervous system drugs\\nincreased 27% primarily due to growth of BUSPAR*, the Company\\'s novel\\nanti-anxiety agent, STADOL NS*, a prescription nasal spray analgesic,\\nand sales of SERZONE*, an antidepressant treatment which offers a low\\nincidence of side effects, launched in the U.S. and other markets in\\n1995.  In addition, PRODAFALGAN*, from the UPSA Group, also contributed\\nto the growth of central nervous system drugs.  Dermatological drug\\nsales increased 9%, largely due to sales of DOVONEX*, a vitamin D3\\nanalog for the treatment of moderate psoriasis.  Increases in sales of\\nESTRACE*, a low-dose estrogen replacement therapy, also contributed to\\nsales growth.  Glucophage, the Company\\'s new oral hypoglycemic agent for\\ntype II (non-insulin dependent) diabetes, a product licensed from the\\nFrench company Lipha for sale in the U.S., was introduced in 1995 and\\nperformed exceptionally well during its first year on the market.\\n\\nIn 1994, pharmaceutical products segment sales increased 7%, as\\nincreases in sales of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, CAPOTEN*, MONOPRIL*, CEFZIL*\\nand BUSPAR* were offset in part by decreases in sales of VEPESID*,\\nCORGARD*, Isovue and AMIKIN*.  In 1993, sales in the segment increased\\n3%, primarily as a result of increases in PRAVACHOL*, MONOPRIL*,\\nanti-cancer, anti-infective and central nervous system drug sales which\\nwere partially offset by decreases in CAPOTEN* and CORGARD*.\\n\\nOperating profit margin, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring,\\nremained relatively constant at 32.7% in 1995, compared to 32.6% in 1994\\nand 32.7% in 1993.\\n\\nIn the Medical Devices Segment, the Company continued to maintain its\\nstrong leadership positions in the orthopaedic implants, arthroscopy,\\npowered instruments, ostomy and wound care products markets.  Sales of\\n$1,906 million reflected a 13% increase over prior year levels.\\nExcluding Calgon Vestal Laboratories, a wound and skin care and\\ninfection control products business purchased in January 1995, and\\nXomed-Treace, Inc., which was divested in April 1994, sales increased\\n7%, reflecting a 4% increase due to volume and a 3% increase due to the\\nfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Price increases had\\nno effect on sales growth for the year.  Excluding the acquisition,\\ndivestiture and the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, domestic sales\\nincreased 1% and international sales increased 7%.  ConvaTec, a division\\nof the Company, is the worldwide market share leader in ostomy care\\nproducts.  Sales of these products increased 14% over the prior year,\\nprimarily due to volume growth of the ACTIVE LIFE/COLODRESS* and\\nSURFIT/COMBIHESIVE/SECURE* product lines in the U.S. and international\\nmarkets.  Excluding the acquisition of Calgon Vestal Laboratories, sales\\nof ConvaTec wound care products increased 17%, due to the ongoing\\n\\n                                      22\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nsuccess of the DUODERM* product line.  The Company\\'s Zimmer division is\\nthe world market share leader in knee and hip replacements.  Worldwide\\nsales of its prosthetic implants increased 3%, led by sales of the\\nNEXGEN* Complete Knee Solution, introduced in 1995, and the continued\\nsuccess of the CENTRALIGN* Precoat Hip Prosthesis.  Sales of the\\nCompany\\'s arthroscopy products experienced strong growth, driven by the\\nAPEX* Universal Drive and Irrigation System, introduced in 1995.\\n\\nIn 1994, worldwide sales of medical devices increased 6% as a result of\\nincreased sales of prosthetic implants, ostomy and wound care products,\\noffset in part by volume declines of other product lines divested in\\n1994 and 1993.  In 1993, sales in the segment increased 2%, primarily\\ndue to increased sales of prosthetic implants, ostomy and wound care\\nproducts.\\n\\nOperating profit margin in the medical devices segment, excluding the\\n1995 provision for restructuring, was 27.0% in 1995, 29.5% in 1994 and\\n28.1% in 1993.  The 1995 decline resulted from increased research and\\ndevelopment and sales force expenditures.  The increase in 1994 to 29.5%\\nfrom 28.1% in 1993 resulted from declines in selling expenses as a\\npercentage of sales.\\n\\nSales in the Nonprescription Health Products Segment, which includes the\\nCompany\\'s worldwide consumer medicines and nutritional products\\nbusinesses, increased 22% to $2,495 million.  In September 1994, the\\nCompany acquired the remaining ownership interest of the UPSA Group, the\\nleading maker and marketer of analgesics in France and Belgium and a\\nworld leader in effervescent technology.  Excluding the acquisition of\\nthe UPSA Group, sales increased 11%, reflecting volume growth.  Price\\nincreases and foreign currency translation had no effect on sales growth\\nfor the year.  Excluding the acquisition and the effect of exchange rate\\nfluctuations, domestic sales increased 10%, while international sales\\nincreased 15%.  In 1995, the Company\\'s Mead Johnson Nutritional Group\\nbecame the U.S. market leader in infant formula.  Volume gains in the\\nCompany\\'s principal infant formulas, the milk-based ENFAMIL* and the\\nsoy-based PROSOBEE*, increased with the addition of new sole-source\\ncontracts, including New York, Florida, Georgia, California and the\\nWestern States Alliance in late 1994 and 1995 under the federal\\ngovernment\\'s WIC program, as well as strong gains in the non-WIC\\nsegments.  Sales of LACTOFREE*, a milk-based, lactose-free infant\\nformula, and NUTRAMIGEN* infant formula also increased, as did the\\nCompany\\'s line of SUSTAGEN* products.  BOOST* and SUSTACAL*, two\\nnutritional beverages launched to consumers in 1995, performed well.\\nSales of analgesics increased primarily due to the strong performance of\\nEXCEDRIN*, the Company\\'s leading analgesic in the U.S., benefiting from\\nthe introduction of EXCEDRIN* Gel Tabs in 1995, strong growth of\\nBUFFERIN* in Japan and sales of EFFERALGAN*, DAFALGAN* and ASPIRINE\\nUPSA* in Europe.\\n\\nIn 1994, worldwide sales of nonprescription health products increased\\n4%, due to increased sales of ENFAMIL*, the introductory sales of NEXT\\nSTEP* Toddler Formula, as well as increased sales of EXCEDRIN*,\\nBUFFERIN* and the addition of products from the UPSA Group.  In 1993,\\nsales in the segment remained at prior year levels as domestic declines,\\nprimarily in analgesics sales, were offset by international increases,\\nprimarily in sales of BUFFERIN* and ISOCAL* adult nutritional products.\\n\\n                                      23\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nOperating profit margin, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring,\\ndecreased to 18.5% in 1995 compared to 22.3% in 1994, primarily due to\\nlower margins on infant formula products as a result of increased\\nparticipation in the WIC program and increased advertising and marketing\\nexpenses in support of the BOOST* and the SUSTACAL* product launches.\\nIn 1994, operating profit margin decreased to 22.3% from 23.6% in 1993,\\npartially as a result of higher manufacturing costs.\\n\\nSales in the Toiletries and Beauty Aids Segment, where Bristol-Myers\\nSquibb has strong franchises in haircoloring, hair care and skin care\\nproducts, increased 21% in 1995 to $1,556 million.  In August 1994, the\\nCompany acquired Matrix Essentials, Inc., the leading manufacturer in\\nNorth America of professional hair care and beauty products sold\\nexclusively in beauty salons.  Excluding the acquisition of Matrix,\\nsales increased 10%, reflecting an 8% increase due to volume, a 3%\\nincrease due to pricing and a 1% decrease due to the unfavorable effect\\nof foreign currency translation.  Excluding the acquisition and foreign\\ncurrency translation, domestic sales increased 7%, while international\\nsales increased 18% over 1994.  The Company\\'s Clairol division continued\\nto maintain its market share leadership in the U.S. in the haircolorings\\nproduct line.  Sales of the Company\\'s haircoloring products were higher,\\nincreasing 10% primarily due to NICE \\'N EASY* and the continued success\\nof NATURAL INSTINCTS*.  Hair care product sales benefited from the\\nSYSTEME BIOLAGE*, VAVOOM!* and MATRIX ESSENTIALS* lines from Matrix\\nEssentials, Inc., and from the introduction of the HERBAL ESSENCES*\\ncomplete line of shampoos and conditioners.  The Company\\'s skin care\\nproducts, primarily the SEA BREEZE* and MATRIX* skin care lines, and the\\nMUM* line of anti-perspirants and deodorants, also contributed to the\\nsegment\\'s growth.\\n\\nIn 1994, sales in the toiletries and beauty aids segment increased 4%,\\nprimarily due to increased sales of haircoloring, hair care and skin\\ncare products, partially offset by decreases in anti-perspirants and\\ndeodorants sales and the 1993 divestiture of the Clairol beauty\\nappliance business.  In 1993, sales in the segment increased 1%\\nprimarily due to increases in sales of haircoloring and skin care\\nproducts.\\n\\nOperating profit margin in 1995, excluding the 1995 provision for\\nrestructuring, was 10.2% compared to 13.1% in 1994, due to increased\\nadvertising and promotion expenditures related to new product\\nintroductions and established products.  In 1994, the operating profit\\nmargin of 13.1% remained relatively unchanged from the 13.2% reported in\\n1993.\\n\\n\\nGEOGRAPHIC AREAS\\n- ----------------\\nBristol-Myers Squibb products are available in virtually every country\\nin the world; its largest markets are the U.S., France and Japan.\\n\\nIn 1995, sales in the U.S. increased 10%, primarily due to strong growth\\nfrom sales of TAXOL*, PRAVACHOL*, PARAPLATIN*, ZERIT*, ENFAMIL*,\\nPROSOBEE*, LACTOFREE*, EXCEDRIN* and NATURAL INSTINCTS* haircoloring.\\nAlso contributing to sales growth in the U.S., were the successful\\nproduct launches of Glucophage, SERZONE*, the NEXGEN* Complete Knee\\nSolution, BOOST* and the HERBAL ESSENCES* complete line of shampoos and\\nconditioners, in addition to products from the acquisitions of Matrix\\n\\n                                      24\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nEssentials and Calgon Vestal Laboratories.  Sales in the U.S., excluding\\nacquisitions, increased 7% compared to 1994.  Excluding the 1995\\nprovision for restructuring, operating profit margin was 27.3% in 1995\\ncompared to 30.1% in 1994.  The decrease in 1995 was the result of lower\\ngross margins on WIC sales and increased advertising and promotion\\nexpenditures for new product launches.  In 1994, sales in the U.S.\\nincreased 4%, primarily due to strong pharmaceutical sales and sales\\nfrom Matrix Essentials, offset in part by volume declines due to the\\ndivestiture of certain businesses in 1993 and early 1994.  Operating\\nprofit margin remained relatively constant at 30.1% in 1994 from 30.0%\\nin 1993.\\n\\nIn 1995 and 1994, international sales increased 22% and 7%,\\nrespectively. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation,\\ninternational sales increased 19% in 1995 and 6% in 1994.\\n\\nSales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa increased 30% due to strong sales\\ngrowth of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, ampicillin, amoxicillin, DURICEF*, ostomy\\nand wound care products and the introductory sales of MAXIPIME*.  Sales\\nof EFFERALGAN*, DAFALGAN*, and ASPIRINE UPSA*, analgesic products from\\nthe UPSA Group, also contributed to sales growth in the region.\\nExcluding the 1995 provision for restructuring, operating profit margin\\nincreased 25.6% in 1995 from 21.5% in 1994, primarily as a result of\\nhigher utilization of manufacturing facilities in lower tax\\njurisdictions.  In 1994, sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa increased\\n6%, primarily due to sales from UPSA, increased sales of CAPOTEN* and\\nMONOPRIL* and introductory sales of TAXOL*.  In 1994, operating profit\\nmargin increased to 21.5% from 19.3% in 1993, primarily due to reduced\\noperating costs in the pharmaceutical products segment.\\n\\nSales in Other Western Hemisphere countries, net of inter-area sales,\\nincreased 5% in 1995 due to strong sales of TAXOL*, cardiovascular drugs,\\nSERZONE* and ostomy care products.  These increases were partially offset\\nby the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Excluding the\\n1995 provision for restructuring, operating profit margin decreased to\\n15.2% from 20.5% in 1994 primarily as a result of lower foreign exchange\\ngains.  In 1994, sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 6%\\nprimarily due to increased sales of anti-infective and cardiovascular\\ndrugs, haircoloring products and the successful launch of TAXOL* in a\\nnumber of countries, including Brazil and Argentina.  The 1994 operating\\nprofit margin increased to 20.5% in 1994 from 20.0% in 1993 primarily due\\nto improvements in the pharmaceutical products segment.\\n\\nSales in the Pacific, net of inter-area sales, increased 16% in 1995 as a\\nresult of increased sales of BUFFERIN*, ENFALAC*, ENFAPRO*, SUSTAGEN\\nJUNIOR*, ALACTA*, anti-infective and cardiovascular drugs, and the SEA\\nBREEZE* product line.  Excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring,\\noperating profit margin was 10.8% in 1995 compared to 13.6% in 1994 due\\nto increased advertising and promotion expenses in support of new product\\nlaunches.  In 1994, sales in the Pacific area increased 9%, as a result\\nof favorable foreign currency translation, increased sales of BUFFERIN*\\nanalgesics, ENFAPRO* follow-on formulas and the launch of SEA BREEZE*\\nhair care products in Japan.  In 1994, operating profit margin decreased\\nto 13.6% from 15.8% in 1993, partially due to declines in the medical\\ndevices and nonprescription health products segments.\\n\\n                                      25\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nFINANCIAL POSITION\\n- ------------------\\nThe Company considers cash, time deposits and marketable securities as\\nits principal measures of liquidity.  These items totaled $2.2 billion at\\nDecember 31, 1995, compared to $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion at December\\n31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Working capital was $2.2 billion at\\nDecember 31, 1995, compared to $2.4 billion and $3.5 billion at December\\n31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Working capital decreased in large\\nmeasure as a result of product liability costs, acquisitions, dividends\\nand the Company\\'s continuing share repurchase program.  Cash, time\\ndeposits and marketable securities and the conversion of other working\\ncapital items are expected to be adequate to fund the near-term operating\\nneeds of the Company.\\n\\nIn order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company\\nengages in hedging activities.  The impact of such hedges on the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations and on its financial position is\\nexplained further in Note 11 to the financial statements.\\n\\nInternally generated cash provided by operations was $2.5 billion in\\n1995, $2.3 billion in 1994 and $2.6 billion in 1993.  Cash provided by\\noperations continued to be the Company\\'s primary source of funds used to\\nfinance operating needs, productivity initiatives and expenditures for\\nnew plant and equipment.  As part of the Company\\'s ongoing commitment to\\nimprove plant efficiency and maintain superior research facilities, the\\nCompany has invested over $1.7 billion in capital expansion during the\\npast three years.  In 1995, the Company opened powder-processing plants\\nin Zeeland, Michigan, the largest infant formula powder plant in the\\nworld, and in Guangzhou, China.  Cash provided by operations was also\\nused to pay dividends of nearly $4.5 billion over the past three years\\nand to fund the $1.4 billion purchase of nearly 24 million shares of the\\nCompany\\'s common stock over the same period.\\n\\n                                      26\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nItem 8.

Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include\\nthe accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its\\nsubsidiaries.\\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily\\ninclude securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time\\nof purchase, recorded at cost, which approximates market.\\n\\nTime Deposits and Marketable Securities - Time deposits and marketable\\nsecurities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value,\\nwhich approximates cost.\\n\\nInventory Valuation - Inventories are generally stated at average\\ncost, not in excess of market.\\n\\nProperty and Depreciation - Expenditures for additions, renewals and\\nbetterments are capitalized at cost.  Depreciation is generally\\ncomputed by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful\\nlives of the related assets.  The range of annual rates used in\\ncomputing provisions for depreciation is 2% to 20% for buildings and\\n5% to 33% for equipment.\\n\\nExcess of Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess of cost over net\\ntangible assets received in business acquisitions subsequent to\\nOctober 31, 1970 is being amortized on a straight-line basis over\\nperiods not exceeding 40 years.\\n\\nEarnings Per Share - Earnings per common share are computed using the\\nweighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.  The\\neffect of shares issuable under stock plans is not significant.\\n\\nNote 2  SPECIAL CHARGE\\n- ----------------------\\n\\nAs described in Note 17, the Company is party to a revised settlement\\nconcerning pending and future breast implant product liability claims\\n(related to a previously discontinued business of a subsidiary)\\nbrought against it, its Medical Engineering Corporation subsidiary,\\nand certain other subsidiaries.  In the fourth quarter of 1993, the\\nCompany recorded a special charge of $500 million before taxes, $310\\nmillion after taxes, or $.60 per share.  The charge consisted of $1.5\\nbillion in anticipation of its share of the then pending settlement\\nand cost of the litigation (recorded as Product Liability), offset by\\n$1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds (recorded as Insurance\\nRecoverable).  Although the Company is currently engaged in coverage\\nlitigation with certain of its insurers, expected insurance proceeds\\nrepresent the amount of insurance which the Company considers\\nappropriate to record as recoverable at this time.\\n\\n                                      31\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n                        (dollars in millions)\\n\\nVarious events occurred in 1994, including a number of claimants\\nopting out of the settlement.  Based upon preliminary analyses of the\\nnumber of such opt outs and of other issues, in the fourth quarter of\\n1994 the Company recorded a special charge to earnings of $750 million\\nbefore taxes, $488 million after taxes, or $.96 per share.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company, with certain other\\ndefendants, entered into a revised settlement of the breast implant\\nproduct liability litigation.  The actual cost to the Company of the\\nbreast implant litigation may be dependant upon a number of factors\\nwhich will not become known for some time, including the number of\\nclass members that participate in the revised settlement, the kinds of\\nclaims approved, the dollar value thereof and the disposition of\\nclaims of non-participants.  However, based on current estimates, the\\nCompany has recorded a charge to earnings in respect of breast implant\\nlitigation of $950 million before taxes, $590 million after taxes, or\\n$1.17 per share.\\n\\nNote 3  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\\n- -------------------------------------\\n\\nIn January 1996, the Company acquired control of Pharmavit\\nGyogyszer-es Elelmiszeripari Reszvenytarsasag, one of Hungary\\'s\\nleading manufacturers of over-the-counter medicines, nutritional\\nproducts and generic pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nIn September 1995, the Company acquired A/S GEA Farmaceutisk Fabrik, a\\nleading manufacturer and marketer of branded generic pharmaceuticals\\nfor the Scandinavian market.\\n\\nIn January 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of Calgon\\nVestal Laboratories, a wound and skin care and infection control\\nproducts business.\\n\\nIn 1994, the Company acquired Matrix Essentials Inc., the leading\\nmanufacturer in North America of professional hair care and beauty\\nproducts sold exclusively in beauty salons, and completed the\\nacquisition of the remaining interest in the UPSA Group which develops\\nand markets a wide range of nonprescription health and pharmaceutical\\nproducts.  The Company sold Squibb Diagnostics and completed the sale\\nof Xomed-Treace, Inc.\\n\\nNote 4  RESTRUCTURING\\n- ---------------------\\n\\nThe Company recorded a $310 million restructuring charge, $198 million\\nafter taxes, in the fourth quarter of 1995.

The most significant of these are described\\nbelow.\\n\\nBreast Implant Litigation\\n- -------------------------\\nAs of December 31, 1995, approximately 20,000 plaintiffs had filed\\nsuit against the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering\\nCorporation (MEC), and certain other subsidiaries, in federal and\\nstate courts and in certain Canadian provincial courts, alleging\\ndamages for personal injuries of various types resulting from\\npolyurethane covered breast implants and smooth walled breast\\nimplants.  Most of these plaintiffs are participants in a 1994 class\\naction settlement approved by the Federal District Court in\\nBirmingham, Alabama; that settlement is now subject to appeals.  A\\nrevision of that settlement, known as the revised settlement, which\\nincludes the Company, MEC and certain other defendants, was approved\\non December 22, 1995.  The order approving the settlement has been\\nappealed.  The revised settlement, applicable only to domestic\\nclaimants, currently does not include approximately 2,600 claimants\\nwho may assert claims based upon MEC implants and who opted out of\\nthe original settlement.  Separate class action settlements for\\neligible claimants have been approved in the provincial courts of\\nQuebec and Ontario.  In January 1996, a notice of the revised\\nsettlement was mailed to approximately 450,000 persons.  Class\\nmembers who wish to do so may now opt out of the revised settlement\\nalthough the Court has cautioned class members against doing so until\\nthey receive additional information as to the status of their claims.\\nIt is not possible on any reliable basis to estimate how many class\\nmembers will participate in or opt out of the settlement.  The cost\\nof the settlement is dependent upon complex and varying factors,\\nincluding the number of class members that participate in the\\nsettlement, the kinds of claims approved and their dollar value.  The\\ncost to the Company of resolving opt out claims is also subject to a\\nnumber of complex uncertainties in addition to the unknown quantity\\nand quality of such claims.  In light of the uncertainties attendant\\nto these and other factors, it is difficult at this time to estimate\\nwith any precision the cost of the breast implant product liability\\nclaims to the Company.  Note 2 sets forth the special charges\\nrecorded in connection with this litigation.  An additional charge to\\nearnings may be required as additional information relating to the\\nrevised settlement and the litigation becomes known.\\n\\nOther Actions\\n- -------------\\nThe Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are defendants in a\\nnumber of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of\\npurported statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula\\nproducts and by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and\\nMississippi, alleging a price fixing conspiracy and other violations\\nof state antitrust or deceptive trade practice laws and seeking\\npenalties and other relief.  On December 6, 1995, a trial in state\\ncourt in Wichita, Kansas, in which the Company and Abbott\\nLaboratories were defendants, concluded with a jury verdict in favor\\n\\n                                      48\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n                        (dollars in millions)\\n\\n\\nof the defendants.  This was the first infant formula indirect\\npurchaser case to go to trial.  The courts in Colorado, Florida,\\nKentucky, Nevada, North Carolina and Tennessee have dismissed similar\\ncomplaints, and the plaintiffs have or are expected to appeal those\\ndismissals.  On June 29, 1995, the Texas Supreme Court handed down a\\ndecision in the Company\\'s favor, holding that the plaintiffs, as\\nindirect purchasers, were barred from proceeding under the Texas\\nDeceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act.  The Company\\nsubsequently settled a separate action brought by the Texas Attorney\\nGeneral.  Motions to certify classes of indirect purchasers of infant\\nformula have been denied in Minnesota, Michigan and by two courts in\\nAlabama, but granted by courts in Wisconsin and South Dakota.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 1995, the Company is a defendant in over 100\\nactions brought against the Company and more than 30 other\\npharmaceutical manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit\\nmanagers in various federal district courts by certain chain\\ndrugstores, supermarket chains and independent drugstores, suing\\neither individually or as representatives of a nationwide class of\\nretail pharmacies that has been certified.  These cases, which have\\nbeen coordinated for pretrial purposes, all seek treble damages and\\ninjunctive relief on account of alleged antitrust violations in the\\npricing and marketing of brand name prescription drugs.  None of the\\nplaintiffs has specified the amount of damages claimed, but\\nplaintiffs in the class action have indicated that they intend to\\nclaim damages, before trebling, ranging from 5% to approximately 20%\\nof the value of their purchases of brand name prescription drugs from\\ndefendants since October 15, 1989.  It is estimated that the class\\nrepresents approximately two-thirds of retail pharmacy purchases of\\nbrand name prescription drugs during the alleged damages period.  The\\nclass action case had been scheduled to go to trial on April 11,\\n1996.  The Company, without admitting any wrongdoing, reached an\\nagreement as of January 31, 1996, to settle the class action.  The\\nsettlement is subject to approval by the court.  Federal cases\\nbrought by retail pharmacies that have opted out of the class remain\\npending.  Cases brought by retail pharmacies in state court under\\nstate law alleging similar grounds are proceeding in California,\\nAlabama, Wisconsin and Minnesota.  Cases brought by consumers in\\nstate court under state law alleging similar grounds have been\\nbrought in California, Washington, Colorado, New York, Arizona,\\nMaine, Alabama and Michigan.\\n\\nThe Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise\\ninvolved in, a number of proceedings brought by the Environmental\\nProtection Agency or comparable state agencies under the\\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act\\n(CERCLA or Superfund) or comparable state laws directed at the\\ncleanup of hazardous waste sites.\\n\\nWhile it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of\\nthese cases, it is the opinion of management that these lawsuits,\\nclaims and proceedings which are pending against the Company are\\nwithout merit or will not have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany\\'s operating results, liquidity or consolidated financial\\nposition.\\n\\n                                      49\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n           (dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\n\\nNote 18  SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)\\n- ------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n                                   First   Second    Third   Fourth\\n                                 Quarter  Quarter  Quarter  Quarter      Year\\n                                 -------  -------  -------  -------   -------\\n1995:\\nNet Sales                         $3,301   $3,445   $3,413   $3,608   $13,767\\nGross Profit                       2,424    2,536    2,483    2,687    10,130\\nNet Earnings/(Loss)*                 657      608      689     (142)    1,812\\nEarnings/(Loss) Per\\n   Common Share*                    1.29     1.20     1.36     (.28)     3.58\\n\\n\\n1994:\\nNet Sales                         $2,834   $2,970   $2,932   $3,248   $11,984\\nGross Profit                       2,089    2,228    2,172    2,373     8,862\\nNet Earnings**                       581      542      621       98     1,842\\nEarnings Per Common Share**         1.14     1.07     1.22      .19      3.62\\n\\n\\n*  In 1995, the fourth quarter and annual results included a charge of\\n   $950 million ($590 million after taxes, or $1.17 per share) for\\n   pending and future product liability claims, and a provision for\\n   restructuring of $310 million ($198 million after taxes).\\n\\n** In 1994, the fourth quarter and annual results included a charge of\\n   $750 million ($488 million after taxes, or $.96 per share) for pending\\n   and future product liability claims.\\n\\n                                      50\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS\\n                     ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nTo the Board of Directors\\nand Stockholders of\\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company\\n\\n\\n\\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the\\nrelated consolidated statements of earnings and retained earnings\\nand of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the\\nfinancial position of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and its\\nsubsidiaries at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, and the results\\nof their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended\\nin conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

BUSINESS.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nGeneral:\\n-------\\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (\"Bristol-Myers Squibb\" or the \"Company\") was\\nincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1933 under\\nthe name Bristol-Myers Company as successor to a New York business started\\nin 1887.  In 1989, Squibb Corporation merged with a subsidiary of\\nBristol-Myers Company, and Bristol-Myers Company changed its name to\\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company.  Bristol-Myers Squibb, through its divisions\\nand subsidiaries, is a major producer and distributor of pharmaceutical\\nproducts, medical devices, nonprescription health products, toiletries and\\nbeauty aids.  In general, the business of the Company\\'s industry segments\\nis not seasonal.\\n\\nINDUSTRY SEGMENTS\\n-----------------\\nReference is made to Note 3 Aquisitions and Divestitures and Note 17\\nSegment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF SEGMENTS\\n-----------------------\\n\\nPharmaceutical Products:\\n-----------------------\\nThis segment includes sales of prescription medicines, mainly\\ncardiovascular, anti-infective and anti-cancer drugs, which comprise about\\n40%, 25% and 20%, respectively, of the segment\\'s sales, central nervous\\nsystem drugs and other pharmaceutical products.

The Company considers the overall protection of its patent,\\ntrademark and license rights to be of material value and acts to protect\\nthese rights from infringement.  The Company believes that, except for the\\nU.S. patent relating to captopril whose expiration date was redefined by\\nlegislation implementing the GATT treaty to February 1996, no single patent\\nor license is of material importance in relation to the business as a\\nwhole.  Due to questions surrounding the implementation of the GATT\\nlegislation, the effect of the new patent expiration date on the Company\\'s\\noverall performance is currently being evaluated.\\n\\nCOMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS\\n---------------------------------------\\nThe markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad\\nbased, heavily competitive and include many competitors.  The principal\\nmeans of competition utilized to market the products of Bristol-Myers\\nSquibb include quality, service, price and product performance.  The\\nproducts of the pharmaceutical products segment and the medical devices\\nsegment are promoted on a national and international basis in medical\\njournals and directly to the medical profession.  Most of the other\\nproducts of Bristol-Myers Squibb are generally advertised and promoted on a\\nnational and international basis through the use of television, radio,\\nprint media, consumer offers, and window and in-store displays.\\nBristol-Myers Squibb\\'s products are principally sold to the wholesale and\\nretail trade both nationally and internationally.  Certain products of the\\npharmaceutical products and medical devices segments are also sold to other\\ndrug manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession.  None of the\\nsegments is dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, such that\\nthe loss of any one or more would have a material adverse effect on the\\nsegment.\\n\\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\\n------------------------\\nResearch and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s businesses,\\nparticularly to the pharmaceutical products segment.  Management continues\\nto place great emphasis on these activities.  Pharmaceutical research and\\ndevelopment is carried out by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical\\nResearch Institute which has major facilities in Princeton and New\\n\\n                                    3\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nBrunswick, New Jersey, Wallingford, Connecticut and Seattle, Washington.\\nPharmaceutical research and development is also carried out at various\\nother facilities in the United States and in Belgium, France, Germany,\\nItaly, Japan, and the United Kingdom.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,108 million in 1994, $1,128 million in 1993\\nand $1,083 million in 1992 on company sponsored research and development\\nactivities.  Pharmaceutical research and development spending, as a\\npercentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 13.6% in 1994 compared to 14.9% in\\n1993 and 14.8% in 1992.\\n\\nREGULATION\\n----------\\nMost aspects of the Company\\'s business are subject to some degree of\\ngovernment regulation in the countries in which its operations are\\nconducted.  The Company\\'s policy is to comply fully with all regulatory\\nrequirements applying to its products and operations.  For some products,\\nand in some countries, government regulation is significant and, in\\ngeneral, there is a trend to more stringent regulation.  The Company\\ndevotes significant time, effort and expense addressing the extensive\\ngovernmental regulatory requirements applicable to its business.\\nGovernmental regulatory actions can result in the recall or seizure of\\nproducts, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the\\nproduction or sale of a product, and other civil and criminal sanctions.\\n\\nIn the United States, the drug, medical device, diagnostic, food and\\ncosmetic industries in which the Company operates have long been subject to\\nregulation by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as to\\nproduct manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.  Assuring\\ncompliance with appropriate laws and regulations requires increasing\\nexpenditures of time and resources.\\n\\nIn addition, governmental bodies in the United States as well as other\\ncountries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care and,\\nin some cases, have focused attention on the pricing of drugs and on\\nappropriate drug utilization.  Government regulation in these areas already\\nexists in some countries and may be expanded significantly in the United\\nStates and other countries in the future.\\n\\nWhile the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may\\nbe affected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its\\nsubstantial experience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements\\nand restrictions on its operations throughout the world and its development\\nof new and improved products should enable it to compete effectively within\\nthis environment.\\n\\nEMPLOYEES\\n---------\\nBristol-Myers Squibb employed approximately 47,700 people at December 31,\\n1994.\\n\\nDOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS\\n-------------------------------\\nReference is made to Note 17 Segment Information in the Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form\\n10-K Annual Report.\\n\\nInternational operations are subject to certain risks which are inherent in\\n\\n                                    4\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nconducting business abroad, including possible nationalization or\\nexpropriation, price and exchange controls, limitations on foreign\\nparticipation in local enterprises and other restrictive governmental\\nactions.  In addition, changes in the relative value of currencies take\\nplace from time to time and their effects may be favorable or unfavorable\\non Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s operations.  There are currency restrictions\\nrelating to repatriation of earnings in certain countries.\\n\\nItem 2.

The U.S. manufacturing facilities total seventeen, of which 47%\\nand 24% are used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and medical\\ndevices, respectively.  The non-U.S. operations include a total of twenty-\\nnine major owned manufacturing facilities, of which 76% and 3% are used in\\nthe manufacture of pharmaceutical products and medical devices,\\nrespectively.  These facilities are located in Australia, Brazil, Canada,\\nChina, Colombia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the\\nNetherlands, the Philippines, South Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and\\nVenezuela, and aggregate approximately 6,336,400 square feet of space.  The\\nrecent increase in the number and square footage of facilities operated is\\nprimarily due to the Company\\'s recent acquisitions.\\n\\nPortions of these facilities and other facilities owned or leased by\\nBristol-Myers Squibb in the United States and elsewhere are used for\\nresearch, administration, storage and distribution.  Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s\\nfacilities are well-maintained, adequately insured and in satisfactory\\ncondition.\\n\\nCapital expenditures for the construction, expansion and modernization of\\nproduction, research and administrative facilities aggregrated $577\\nmillion, $580 million and $654 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nItem 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\\n\\nBreast Implant Litigation\\n-------------------------\\nAs of March 1, 1995, approximately 20,000 plaintiffs have filed suit\\nagainst the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC),\\nand certain other subsidiaries, in federal and state courts and in certain\\nCanadian provincial courts, alleging damages for personal injuries of\\nvarious types resulting from polyurethane covered breast implants and\\nsmooth walled breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC or its\\npredecessor.  Most of these plaintiffs are participants in the pending\\nclass action settlement referred to below.  A number of other manufacturers\\n\\n                                    5\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nof breast implants, as well as suppliers of component parts and other\\nparties, are also defendants in many of these cases.  The plaintiffs\\ntypically seek damages for alleged medical ailments as well as punitive\\ndamages.  Some of these women have sued numerous manufacturers without\\nspecifying the manufacturer of the implants involved.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s insurers have been notified of the breast implant claims and\\nthe settlement and certain insurers have reserved their rights or declined\\nto confirm coverage.  In 1993, the Company commenced litigation in state\\ncourt, Jefferson County, Texas, against most of the Company\\'s insurers,\\nseeking damages and a declaration of coverage.  A trial of the insurance\\ncoverage case is expected in 1996.\\n\\nIn June 1992, all federal breast implant cases were consolidated for\\npre-trial purposes in the Northern District of Alabama following the\\ncertification of a federal class action of all breast implant recipients\\nand their spouses.  Early in 1994 the Company, MEC and other defendants and\\ncertain plaintiffs negotiated a settlement regarding all pending and future\\nbreast implant product liability claims brought in the United States\\nagainst certain defendants.  The settlement was subject to court approval\\nand permitted claimants to elect not to participate (opt out).  The\\nsettlement would create a series of claim funds to which settling\\ndefendants would contribute various amounts over approximately 30 years.\\nUnder the settlement, the aggregate contribution to be made by the Company\\nand MEC is to be no more than $1.154 billion.  In the fourth quarter of\\n1993, in anticipation of the settlement, the Company recorded a charge of\\n$500 million before taxes ($310 million after taxes).  The charge consisted\\nof $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses, offset by $1\\nbillion of expected insurance proceeds.  (Reference is made to Note 2\\nSpecial Charge in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\\nin Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.)\\n\\nOn September 1, 1994, the United States District Court gave its approval to\\nthe settlement.  The court excluded claimants from Quebec, Ontario and\\nAustralia from the settlement but allowed voluntary participation by such\\nwomen.  Appeals of the court\\'s order approving the settlement have been\\nfiled, primarily by health insurers, health care organizations and foreign\\nclaimants.\\n\\nThe court has reported that as of February 28, 1995, 7,270 United States\\nwomen and 2,174 foreign women have elected to opt out of the settlement as\\nto all defendants.  With respect to opt outs by women from the United\\nStates, the Company currently estimates that approximately 3,000 women may\\nassert claims based upon MEC implants, approximately 2,200 of whom reside\\nin Texas.  The Company has, at this time, identified approximately 300 of\\nthe foreign opt outs as having MEC implants.  A number of the opt outs\\ncannot, at this time, be identified as having implants of any particular\\nmanufacturer.  The Company does not yet know the number of opt outs who\\nhave received implants from more than one company.  With respect to many\\nwomen who have opted out little is known about the nature of their claims.\\nSome women who have opted out and who are said to have MEC implants have\\nnot yet sued the Company.  The exact number of lawsuits that will remain\\nin the event the settlement becomes effective is unknown at this time.\\n\\nThe cost to the Company of resolving the opt out claims is subject to a\\nnumber of uncertainties in addition to the unknown quantity and quality of\\nsuch claims.  The relatively few trials against breast implant\\nmanufacturers have produced mixed results, and additional trials may affect\\n\\n                                    6\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nthe outlook.  The Company has maintained throughout this litigation that\\nbreast implants do not cause disease and that reliance by plaintiffs\\'\\nexperts upon case studies rather than epidemiological data is insufficient.\\nThe results of continuing medical research and a variety of additional\\nfactors, including the success of other legal defenses, may substantially\\naffect the cost of resolving opt out cases.\\n\\nThe success of the settlement depends, in part, upon the number and total\\namount of claims filed and approved.  The number of claimants who will seek\\nto participate in the settlement is unknown.  As of January 1995 the court\\nadvised that approximately 350,000 women had registered with the claims\\noffice, and the registration deadline was extended to March 1, 1995.\\nHowever, since all women with implants were urged by the court to register,\\nthe number of registrants will not indicate the number of women who have\\nfiled or will file claims against the settlement funds.\\n\\nThe deadline for filing claims against the settlement\\'s current disease\\ncompensation fund passed on September 16, 1994.  The court has not advised\\nthe parties of the number of current disease claims but the indication from\\nthe court is that the number is substantial.  If the total amount of the\\napproved current claims exceeds certain levels, the settlement provides for\\nreduction of scheduled payments to women and the opportunity for claimants\\nto opt out of the settlement.  If that occurs, the settlement also provides\\nthat the parties shall consider changes in the settlement\\'s terms and each\\ndefendant will also have an opportunity to withdraw from the settlement.\\nWhile the Company did not expect to receive from the court definitive\\ninformation as to the total amount of approved current claims before late 1995,\\nthe court has recently advised that it has commenced a random sampling of\\nclaims with the objective of materially accelerating the availability of\\ninformation as to the likelihood and range of any such reduction in scheduled\\npayments.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a special charge to\\nearnings of $750 million before taxes ($488 million after taxes) on account\\nof developments in this litigation, such as the opt outs by claimants.  An\\nadditional charge to earnings may be required as additional information and\\ncontingencies related to the litigation become known or can be reasonably\\nestimated.\\n\\nDES Litigation\\n--------------\\nThe Company is a defendant in a number of actions brought against it and\\nother pharmaceutical companies in federal and state courts by the children\\nor grandchildren of women who ingested diethylstilbestrol (DES), a product\\nwhich had been, but is no longer, manufactured or sold by an affiliate of\\nthe Company.  While it is not possible to determine the outcome of these\\nactions, the Company believes that the ultimate disposition of these\\nmatters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s operating\\nresults, liquidity or consolidated financial position.\\n\\nInfant Formula Matters\\n----------------------\\nThe Company, one of its subsidiaries and others are defendants in antitrust\\nactions in 19 states filed on behalf of purported statewide classes of\\nindirect purchasers of infant formula products and by the Attorneys General\\nof Mississippi and Texas alleging a conspiracy regarding pricing of infant\\nformula products and other violations of state antitrust or deceptive trade\\npractices laws and seeking treble damages, statutory and civil penalties\\n\\n                                    7\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nand injunctive and other relief.  Motions to dismiss the state court\\nactions in Colorado and Florida have been granted and plaintiffs have\\nappealed.  In one of the Texas actions, the trial court\\'s dismissal of an\\namended class action complaint by indirect purchasers has been reversed and\\nthat decision has been appealed to the Texas Supreme Court.  In a Louisiana\\naction, a federal court\\'s decision to remand the case has been appealed.\\nIn addition, the State of Louisiana has filed a federal court action\\nagainst the Company and others asserting claims similar to those previously\\nasserted by the State of Florida and dismissed by the federal court in the\\nNorthern District of Florida.  The State of Louisiana\\'s case has been\\ntransferred for pre-trial purposes to the Northern District of Florida\\nwhere the original and first amended complaints were dismissed but\\nplaintiffs\\' motion to file a second amended complaint is pending.\\nPlaintiffs\\' motions for class certification were granted in Wisconsin and\\nKansas.  The Company and one of its subsidiaries have settled the claims of\\nthe Nestle Food Company alleging that the Company, one of its subsidiaries\\nand others conspired to restrain competition in and maintain artificial\\nbarriers to entry into the United States infant formula market and engaged\\nin other violations of federal and state antitrust or other laws.  The\\nNestle action continues against the remaining defendants.  There are\\npending investigations of infant formula pricing and marketing by five\\nstate Attorneys General.  The Canadian Bureau of Competition Policy has\\ncommenced a civil and criminal inquiry into alleged anticompetitive\\npractices among the Company and certain other members of the Canadian\\ninfant formula industry.  The Company believes that the foregoing matters\\nare without merit and that their ultimate disposition will not have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\\'s operating results, liquidity or\\nconsolidated financial position.\\n\\nPharmaceutical Pricing Litigation\\n---------------------------------\\nThe Company, along with more than 30 other pharmaceutical manufacturers,\\ndrug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers, is a defendant in over 63\\nactions brought by over 2,300 plaintiffs in various federal courts seeking\\ndamages and injunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws for alleged\\nantitrust violations in the pricing and marketing of brand-name\\nprescription drugs.  The federal court cases have been transferred for\\npre-trial purposes to the United States District Court for the Northern\\nDistrict of Illinois.  These lawsuits are of three different varieties:\\n(1) individual actions by independent retail pharmacies; (2) class actions\\nby retail pharmacies seeking to represent a class comprised of those\\nalleged to be similarly situated; and (3) individual actions by large\\nretail pharmacy chains and supermarkets.  The Court has denied motions by\\nthe defendant manufacturers to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings\\nand a motion by the defendant wholesalers for summary judgment.  The Court\\nhas certified a class consisting of all persons (other than defendants,\\nnon-defendant wholesalers and certain others) who purchased brand-name\\nprescription drugs directly from any of the defendants during the period\\nfrom October 15, 1989, to the present.  The defendants have entered into a\\njudgment sharing arrangement, which plaintiffs are seeking to invalidate.\\nThe Court has set a trial date of February 5, 1996.  Discovery is ongoing.\\n\\nIn addition, the Company, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers,\\nwholesalers, certain pharmacy benefit managers and others, has been named\\nas a defendant in state court actions in California, Alabama, Wisconsin,\\nWashington and Minnesota.  These actions seek damages and injunctive relief\\nunder antitrust and other laws of the states in question for alleged\\nviolations in the pricing of prescription drugs, in some cases including\\n\\n                                    8\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nthose not sold under brand names.  The actions in Wisconsin and Minnesota\\nand several of the California actions are brought on behalf of purported\\nclasses of retail pharmacies.  The Alabama case is brought on behalf of\\nindividual retail pharmacies.  The Washington action and one of the\\nCalifornia actions are brought on behalf of purported classes of consumers.\\nThe California actions have been consolidated in the Superior Court for\\nSan Francisco.  Defendants\\' demurrers in the California actions have been\\ndenied.  Discovery has commenced in some of these actions.  Others are\\nstill at the pleading stage.  The Company believes that these actions are\\nwithout merit and that their ultimate disposition will not have a material\\nadverse effect on the Company\\'s results of operations, liquidity or\\nconsolidated financial position.\\n\\nSecurities Litigation\\n---------------------\\nThe Company has entered into a settlement of a class action filed in the\\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging\\nviolations of federal securities laws and regulations in connection with,\\namong other things, earnings projections.  At a hearing on March 10, 1995,\\nthe court approved the settlement, but has not yet entered the final order\\nand judgment.  The settlement will not have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany\\'s operating results, liquidity or consolidated financial position.\\n\\nEnvironmental Matters\\n---------------------\\nThe Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in,\\na number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection Agency or\\ncomparable state agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response\\nCompensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or comparable state\\nlaws directed at the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.  While it is not\\npossible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, the Company\\nbelieves that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\\'s operating results, liquidity or\\nconsolidated financial position.\\n\\nItem 4.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\\n        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n-------\\nDuring 1994, Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s worldwide sales increased 5% over the\\nprior year to $12.0 billion.  Domestic sales increased 4% to $7.0 billion,\\nwhile international sales increased 7% to $5.0 billion.\\n\\nExcluding the 1994 and 1993 special charges recorded in connection with\\npending and future breast implant product liability claims, earnings before\\nincome taxes increased 8% to $3,305 million in 1994, while net earnings\\nincreased 3% to $2,330 million and earnings per share increased 4% to $4.58\\nfrom $4.40 in 1993.  Including these charges, earnings before income taxes\\nwere $2,555 million in 1994 and $2,571 million in 1993, net earnings were\\n$1,842 million in 1994 and $1,959 million in 1993 and earnings per share\\nwere $3.62 in 1994 and $3.80 in 1993.\\n\\nDuring 1994 and early 1995, the Company made significant external\\ninvestments to build sales and earnings.  The acquisition of the remaining\\nownership interest in the UPSA Group, the leading maker and marketer of\\nanalgesics in France and Belgium and a world leader in effervescent\\ntechnology, was completed.  The Company also acquired Matrix Essentials,\\nInc., the leading manufacturer in North America of professional hair care\\nand beauty products sold exclusively in beauty salons, and equity stakes in\\nAzupharma GmbH, one of Germany\\'s major generic pharmaceutical companies,\\nand Cadus Pharmaceutical, a biotechnology company that develops novel drug\\nscreening techniques.  In January 1995, the Company completed the\\nacquisition of Calgon Vestal Laboratories, a skin care and infection\\ncontrol products business.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb\\'s financial position remains strong.  At December 31,\\n1994, the Company held $2.4 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable\\nsecurities.  Cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.3 billion and\\ncontinued to be the primary source to finance research, new product\\ndevelopment and introductions, capital spending and working capital needs.\\nIt also was used to pay dividends of nearly $1.5 billion in 1994.\\nDividends per common share were $2.92 in 1994, increasing from $2.88 per\\nshare paid in 1993.  In December 1994, an additional dividend increase was\\nannounced, with a 1995 indicated annual payment of $2.96.  With this 1995\\nannual payment, Bristol-Myers Squibb dividends will have increased at a\\ncompound annual growth rate of 13% over the past 10 years.  Bristol-Myers\\nSquibb\\'s strong financial position is evidenced further by its triple A\\ncredit rating, substantial unused borrowing capacity and high return on\\nequity.\\n\\nNET SALES AND EARNINGS\\n----------------------\\nWorldwide sales increased 5% in 1994 to $12.0 billion, compared to\\nincreases of 2% and 6% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Volume growth was\\nthe primary contributor to the increase in sales in 1994, while price\\nincreases contributed 1% to growth in the U.S. and on a worldwide basis.\\nExchange rate fluctuations had no effect on total sales growth for the\\nyear.  In 1993, the 2% increase in sales reflected a 3% increase due to\\nvolume, a 2% increase due to pricing, offset in part by a 3% decrease due\\nto the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Domestic sales\\nincreased 4% in 1993 compared to 1% in 1992, while international sales\\nremained constant in 1993 and increased 12% in 1992.\\n\\n                                    19\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nThe Company previously reported its agreement to settle pending and future\\nbreast implant product liability claims (related to a previously\\ndiscontinued business of a subsidiary) brought against it, its Medical\\nEngineering Corporation subsidiary, and certain other subsidiaries.  The\\nCompany recorded a charge in 1993 of $500 million before taxes, $310\\nmillion after taxes, or $.60 per share.  The charge consisted of $1.5\\nbillion in anticipation of its share of the pending settlement and costs of\\nthe litigation, offset by expected insurance proceeds of $1 billion.\\n\\nVarious events occurred in 1994, including a number of claimants opting out\\nof the settlement (see Notes 2 and 18 to the financial statements).  Based\\nupon preliminary analyses of the number of such opt outs and of other\\nissues, in the fourth quarter of 1994 the Company recorded a special charge\\nto earnings of $750 million before taxes, $488 million after taxes, or $.96\\nper share.\\n\\nAs a result of these charges, net earnings were $1,842 million, or $3.62\\nper share, in 1994 and $1,959 million, or $3.80 per share, in 1993.  In the\\nfourth quarter of 1992, a charge of $890 million before taxes, $570 million\\nafter taxes, or $1.10 per share, was recorded in connection with various\\nrestructuring actions.  Earnings from continuing operations were $1,538\\nmillion, or $2.97 per share, in 1992.  Excluding the charges, net earnings\\nwere $2,330 million, or $4.58 per share, in 1994 and $2,269 million, or\\n$4.40 per share, in 1993, and earnings from continuing operations were\\n$2,108 million, or $4.07 per share, in 1992.\\n\\nThe effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 27.9% in\\n1994 compared to 23.8% and 22.6% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Excluding\\nthe charges, the effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes\\nwas 29.5% in 1994, 26.1% in 1993 and 26.7% in 1992.  The higher 1994\\neffective income tax rate resulted from the curtailment of certain tax\\nbenefits from Puerto Rico operations, enacted in the Omnibus Budget\\nReconciliation Act of 1993.\\n\\nEXPENSES\\n--------\\nTotal costs and expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding the charges,\\nwere 72.4% in 1994 compared to 73.1% in 1993 and 74.2% in 1992.  As a\\npercentage of sales, cost of products sold decreased to 26.1% in 1994 from\\n26.5% in 1993 due to favorable product mix and the divestiture of\\nbusinesses with higher cost of sales.  In 1993, cost of products sold\\nincreased as a percentage of sales from 25.6% in 1992 primarily as a result\\nof higher manufacturing costs of newer pharmaceutical products.\\n\\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,\\ndecreased to 26.4% in 1994 from 27.1% in 1993 and 27.6% in 1992 primarily\\nas a result of reductions in selling expenses and the Company\\'s ongoing\\ncommitment to contain administrative costs.\\n\\nAdvertising and promotion expenses in support of new and existing products\\nincreased to $1,367 million in 1994 from $1,255 million in 1993 primarily\\nas a result of increases in the toiletries and beauty aids segment, due to\\nthe addition of Matrix, and in the pharmaceutical products segment, in\\npreparation for the launches of certain products.  In 1993, advertising and\\npromotion expenses decreased from 1992 levels due to lower spending in the\\nnonprescription health and pharmaceutical products segments, offset in part\\nby increased spending in the toiletries and beauty aids segment.\\n\\n                                    20\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nThe Company\\'s investment in research and development in 1994 totaled $1,108\\nmillion, which approximated 1993 and 1992 levels.  The high level of\\nspending reflects the Company\\'s continued commitment to research over a\\nbroad range of therapeutic areas and clinical development in support of\\nnewer products.  Over the last 10 years, research and development expenses\\nincreased at a compound annual growth rate of 13%.  In 1994, research and\\ndevelopment spending dedicated to the discovery and development of\\npharmaceutical products was 13.6% of pharmaceutical sales compared to 14.9%\\nand 14.8% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.\\n\\nINDUSTRY SEGMENTS\\n-----------------\\nBy the end of 1994, Bristol-Myers Squibb had 26 products with more than\\n$100 million in annual sales, including products from all four industry\\nsegments.  In general, the business of the Company\\'s industry segments is\\nnot seasonal.\\n\\nSales in the Pharmaceutical Products Segment, which represents the largest\\nsegment at 58% of total company sales, increased 7% in 1994 to $6,970\\nmillion.  Volume growth was the primary contributor to this increase while\\nprice increases had only a 1% effect.  Exchange rate fluctuations had no\\neffect on the segment\\'s sales growth for the year.  Domestic and\\ninternational sales increased 9% and 4%, respectively, primarily due to\\nvolume growth.  Sales of cardiovascular drugs, the largest product group in\\nthe segment at $2.8 billion, increased 8%.  Captopril, an angiotensin\\nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and the Company\\'s largest selling\\nproduct, is primarily sold under the trademark CAPOTEN*.  In the U.S., the\\nexpiration date of the CAPOTEN* patent was redefined by legislation\\nimplementing the GATT treaty to February 1996.  Due to questions\\nsurrounding the implementation of the GATT legislation, the effect of the\\nnew patent expiration date on the Company\\'s overall performance is\\ncurrently being evaluated.  In Germany, the patent expiration for CAPOTEN*\\nwas February 1995.  Sales of captopril increased 4% in 1994 to $1.5 billion\\n($581 million in the U.S.) benefiting from new indications for the\\ntreatment of diabetic nephropathy and left ventricular dysfunction.\\nPRAVACHOL*, the Company\\'s largest selling cholesterol-lowering agent with\\nsales exceeding $640 million, and MONOPRIL*, a second generation ACE\\ninhibitor with once-a-day dosage, performed well, with good volume growth\\nin the U.S. and in overseas markets.  Sales of the Company\\'s\\nanti-infectives decreased 2% to $1.5 billion as increases in sales of\\nCEFZIL*, an oral cephalosporin used in the treatment of respiratory\\ninfections, and introductory sales of ZERIT*, the Company\\'s new\\nantiretroviral drug approved in the U.S. in June 1994, were more than\\noffset by declines in sales of AZACTAM*, VIDEX*, AMIKIN*, which is\\nexperiencing generic competition, and in broad spectrum penicillins.  In\\nthe Company\\'s line of anti-cancer drugs, sales increased 13% to $1.3\\nbillion, strengthening the Company\\'s leadership position in cancer therapy.\\nSales of TAXOL* (paclitaxel), the Company\\'s newest anti-cancer agent, were\\nstrong.  In April 1994, TAXOL* received clearance in the U.S. for use in\\nthe treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy\\nfor metastatic disease or relapse within six months of adjuvant\\nchemotherapy.  In late 1992, TAXOL* was initially cleared in the U.S. and\\nCanada for treatment of patients with ovarian cancer whose first-line or\\nsubsequent chemotherapy has failed, and, during 1993 and 1994, TAXOL*\\nreceived clearance for marketing in a number of countries in Europe, Latin\\nAmerica and the Pacific area.  Sales of PLATINOL* and PARAPLATIN* also\\nincreased.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of\\nVEPESID* (the patent for which expired in the U.S. in November 1993).\\n\\n                                    21\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nSales of central nervous system drugs increased 17% primarily due to growth\\nof STADOL NS*, a prescription nasal spray analgesic, and BUSPAR*, the\\nCompany\\'s novel anti-anxiety agent.  Dermatological drug sales increased\\nwith the introduction of DOVONEX*, a vitamin D3 analogue for the treatment\\nof moderate psoriasis.  In July 1994, the Company sold Squibb Diagnostics,\\nits contrast media and radiopharmaceuticals businesses, to Bracco S.p.A.\\nThe Company will continue manufacturing certain diagnostic products,\\nincluding ProHance and Isovue, and nuclear medicine products.  The Company\\nalso will act as Bracco\\'s distributor in Canada.\\n\\nIn December 1994, the Company received FDA approval to market SERZONE*, a\\nnew antidepressant.  It is expected that Glucophage, the Company\\'s new oral\\nanti-diabetes agent for Type II non-insulin dependent diabetes, a product\\nlicensed from the French company Lipha, will be marketed in 1995.\\n\\nIn 1993, pharmaceutical products segment sales increased 3% with a 5%\\nincrease due to volume, a 1% increase due to pricing and a 3% decrease due\\nto the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Increases in\\nsales of PRAVACHOL*, MONOPRIL*, CEFZIL*, VEPESID* and BUSPAR* and\\nintroductory sales of TAXOL* were offset in part by decreases in sales of\\nCAPOTEN*, CORGARD* and AMIKIN*.  In 1992, sales in the segment increased 7%\\nprimarily as a result of increased cardiovascular, anti-infective,\\nanti-cancer and central nervous system drug sales.\\n\\nOperating profit margin in 1994 of 32.6% remained relatively constant with\\nthe 32.7% reported in the prior year.  In 1993, operating profit margin\\nincreased to 32.7% from 31.0% in 1992, excluding the restructuring charge.\\nThe increase in 1993 resulted from reductions in selling and advertising\\nexpenses, offset in part by higher manufacturing costs of newer\\npharmaceutical products.\\n\\nIn the Medical Devices Segment, sales of $1,685 million remained relatively\\nconstant with prior year levels.  Excluding the sales of Edward Weck\\nIncorporated, which was divested in December 1993, and Xomed-Treace, Inc.,\\nwhich was divested in April 1994, sales increased 6%, reflecting a 4%\\nincrease due to volume, a 1% increase due to pricing and a 1% increase due\\nto the favorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Accordingly,\\ndomestic sales increased 1%, while international sales increased 12%.\\nWorldwide sales of prosthetic implants, which were adversely affected by\\ncompetitive pressures, increased 2% with growth of the Insall/Burstein II\\nModular Total Knee System, the MG II* Total Knee System and the CENTRALIGN*\\nPrecoat Hip Prosthesis.  Sales of ostomy care products increased 9% over\\nthe prior year, with volume growth of the ACTIVE LIFE/COLODRESS* and the\\nSUR-FIT/COMBIHESIVE* product lines in the U.S. and in international\\nmarkets.  As a result of continued product enhancements, the Company is the\\nworldwide market share leader in sales of ostomy care products.  Sales of\\nwound care products increased 18% due to the ongoing success of the\\nDUODERM* product line.  In January 1995, the Company completed the\\nacquisition of Calgon Vestal Laboratories, a skin care and infection\\ncontrol products business.\\n\\nIn 1993, worldwide sales of medical devices increased 2% as a result of a\\n3% increase due to pricing, a 1% increase due to volume and a 2% decrease\\ndue to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.  The sales\\ngrowth primarily resulted from increased sales of prosthetic implants,\\nostomy and wound care products.  In 1992, sales in the segment increased 7%\\nprimarily due to increased sales of prosthetic implants, ostomy, wound care\\nand arthroscopy products, offset in part by volume declines due to product\\n\\n                                    22\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nlines divested in 1991.\\n\\nOperating profit margin in the medical devices segment was 29.5% in 1994,\\n28.1% in 1993 and 27.6% in 1992, excluding the charges.  The increase in\\n1994 resulted from declines in selling expenses as a percentage of sales,\\nwhile the increase in 1993 resulted from declines in selling and\\nadministrative expenses.  As a result of the special charges recorded in\\nconnection with pending and future breast implant product liability claims\\nand related expenses, the medical devices segment recorded operating losses\\nof $253 million in 1994 and $24 million in 1993.\\n\\nSales in the Nonprescription Health Products Segment increased 4% to $2,043\\nmillion with a 3% increase due to pricing and a 1% increase due to volume.\\nExchange rate fluctuations had no effect on the segment\\'s sales growth for\\nthe year.  Sales of infant formulas increased 3% over prior year levels due\\nto ENFAMIL*, the Company\\'s leading routine infant formula, LACTOFREE*, a\\nmilk-based, lactose-free infant formula, and introductory sales of NEXT\\nSTEP* Toddler Formula, a formula intended for toddlers up to 18 months and\\nbeyond.  During 1994, several new contracts under the federal government\\'s\\nWomen, Infants and Children (WIC) program became effective.  Sales of\\nanalgesics increased 10% on a worldwide basis with the addition of\\nEFFERALGAN*, ASPIRINE UPSA* and DAFALGAN* from UPSA, enhancing the\\nCompany\\'s participation in Europe\\'s growing self-medication marketplace.\\nSales of analgesics also reflected increased sales of EXCEDRIN*, the\\nCompany\\'s largest selling analgesic in the U.S., and increased sales of\\nBUFFERIN* in Japan.\\n\\nIn 1993, worldwide sales of nonprescription health products remained at\\nprior year levels as domestic declines, primarily in sales of EXCEDRIN* and\\nBUFFERIN* analgesics which were adversely affected by increased competition\\nin the U.S. market, were offset by international increases, primarily in\\nsales of BUFFERIN* analgesics and ISOCAL* adult nutritional products.  In\\n1992, sales in the segment increased 3% as a result of international sales\\ngrowth of ENFAMIL*, ENFAPRO* and PROSOBEE* infant formulas and BUFFERIN*\\nanalgesics.\\n\\nOperating profit margin was 22.3% in 1994 compared to 23.6% in 1993\\npartially as a result of higher manufacturing costs.  In 1993, operating\\nprofit margin of 23.6% remained relatively unchanged from the 23.7%\\nreported in 1992, excluding the restructuring charge.\\n\\nSales in the Toiletries and Beauty Aids Segment increased 4% in 1994 to\\n$1,286 million, reflecting a 3% increase due to pricing and a 1% increase\\ndue to volume.  Exchange rate fluctuations had no effect on the segment\\'s\\nsales growth for the year.  Domestic sales increased 8%, while\\ninternational sales decreased 2%.  Sales of the Company\\'s haircoloring\\nproducts reflected strong growth, increasing 16% primarily due to NICE \\'N\\nEASY*, LASTING COLOR BY LOVING CARE* and ULTRESS*, as well as introductory\\nsales of NATURAL INSTINCTS*, launched in the U.S. in the latter part of\\n1994.  Hair care product sales benefited from the SYSTEME BIOLAGE*,\\nVAVOOM!* and MATRIX ESSENTIALS* lines from Matrix Essentials, Inc.\\nIncreases in sales of the Company\\'s skin care products primarily resulted\\nfrom the introduction of several new products in the SEA BREEZE* line in\\nthe U.S., as well as the addition of the MATRIX* skin care line.  These\\nincreases were partially offset by decreased sales of BAN* anti-perspirants\\nand deodorants, due to increased competition in the U.S., and the\\ndivestiture of the Clairol beauty appliance business in December 1993.\\n\\n                                    23\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nIn 1993, sales in the toiletries and beauty aids segment increased 1% with\\na 2% increase due to pricing, a 1% increase due to volume and a 2% decrease\\ndue to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.  The sales\\ngrowth was primarily due to introductory sales of GLINTS* Conditioning\\nColor Enhancer, LASTING COLOR BY LOVING CARE* and BRIGHTS BY NICE \\'N EASY*\\nhaircoloring products, as well as sales from Laboratori Guieu, an Italian\\nover-the-counter skin care company acquired in early 1993.  In 1992, sales\\nin the segment increased 1% as increased sales of anti-perspirants and\\nhaircoloring products were partially offset by declines in beauty\\nappliances and hair care products.\\n\\nOperating profit margin in 1994 was 13.1%, relatively unchanged from the\\n13.2% reported in 1993 and the 13.1% reported in 1992, after adjusting for\\nthe restructuring charge.\\n\\nGEOGRAPHIC AREAS\\n----------------\\nIn 1994, sales in the U.S. increased 4% primarily due to strong\\npharmaceutical sales and sales from Matrix, offset in part by volume\\ndeclines due to the divestiture of certain businesses in 1993 and early\\n1994.  Excluding the special charges, operating profit margin increased to\\n30.1% in 1994 from 30.0% in 1993 primarily as a result of declines in\\nselling expenses.  In 1993, sales in the U.S. increased 4% primarily as a\\nresult of gains in the pharmaceutical products segment.  Operating profit\\nmargin, after adjusting for the charges, increased to 30.0% in 1993 from\\n28.0% in 1992 due to declines in selling and administrative expenses,\\noffset in part by increased manufacturing costs of newer pharmaceutical\\nproducts.\\n\\nInternational sales increased 7% in 1994, while in 1993 international sales\\nremained at prior year levels.  Excluding the effect of foreign currency\\ntranslation, international sales increased 6% in 1994 and 5% in 1993.\\n\\nSales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area sales, increased 6%\\nin 1994 primarily due to sales from UPSA, increased sales of CAPOTEN* and\\nMONOPRIL* and introductory sales of TAXOL*.  Operating profit margin\\nincreased to 21.5% from 19.3% in 1993 primarily due to reduced operating\\ncosts in the pharmaceutical products segment.  In 1993, sales in Europe,\\nMid-East and Africa decreased 8% as a result of unfavorable foreign\\ncurrency translation and lower pharmaceutical sales in certain European\\ncountries due in part to government cost-containment measures.  Operating\\nprofit margin was 19.3% compared to 21.1% in 1992, excluding the\\nrestructuring charge.\\n\\nSales in Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 6% in 1994 primarily\\ndue to increased sales of anti-infective and cardiovascular drugs, strong\\nsales of haircoloring products and the successful launch of TAXOL* in a\\nnumber of countries, including Brazil and Argentina.  Operating profit\\nmargin increased to 20.5% from 20.0% in 1993 primarily due to improvement\\nin the pharmaceutical products segment.  In 1993, sales in Other Western\\nHemisphere countries increased 5% reflecting increased sales of\\nanti-infectives, cardiovasculars, haircoloring products and\\nanti-perspirants in Latin America.  Operating profit margin was 20.0% in\\n1993, relatively unchanged from 20.1% reported in 1992 after adjusting for\\nthe restructuring charge.\\n\\nSales in the Pacific area increased 9% in 1994 with favorable foreign\\ncurrency translation, increased sales of BUFFERIN* analgesics and ENFAPRO*\\n\\n                                    24\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nfollow-on formulas, as well as the successful launch of SEA BREEZE*\\nshampoos and conditioners in Japan.  Operating profit margin was 13.6%\\ncompared to 15.8% in 1993 partially due to declines in the medical devices\\nand nonprescription health products segments.  In 1993, sales in the\\nPacific area increased 15% as a result of favorable foreign currency\\ntranslation and increased sales of prosthetic implants, infant formulas and\\nanti-cancer drugs.  Operating profit margin increased to 15.8% in 1993 from\\n12.6% in 1992, excluding the restructuring charge, primarily as a result of\\nimprovements in the pharmaceutical products and medical devices segments.\\n\\nFINANCIAL POSITION\\n------------------\\nThe Company considers cash, time deposits and marketable securities as its\\nprincipal measures of liquidity.  These items remained at a high level\\ntotaling $2.4 billion at December 31, 1994 compared to $2.7 billion and\\n$2.4 billion at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Working capital\\nalso was strong, totaling $2.4 billion at December 31, 1994, although\\ndecreasing from 1993 and 1992 levels.  The decrease in working capital\\nprimarily resulted from an increase in short-term borrowings issued in\\nconnection with the UPSA acquisition and an increase in product liability.\\nCash, time deposits and marketable securities and the conversion of other\\nworking capital items are expected to be adequate to fund the operations of\\nthe Company.\\n\\nIn order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company\\nengages in hedging activities.  The impact of such hedges on the Company\\'s\\nresults of operations and on its financial position is explained further in\\nNote 12 to the financial statements.\\n\\nInternally generated cash provided by operations remained strong and\\ncontinued to be the Company\\'s primary source of funds to finance operating\\nneeds, to pay dividends of nearly $4.4 billion over the past three years\\nand to finance expenditures for new plant and equipment.  As part of the\\nCompany\\'s ongoing commitment to improve plant efficiency and maintain\\nsuperior research facilities, the Company has invested over $1.8 billion in\\ncapital expansion over the past three years.  Cash provided by operations\\nalso was used in large part to fund the $1.3 billion purchase of nearly 23\\nmillion shares of common stock during the three year period ended December\\n31, 1994.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    25\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nItem 8.

STATEMENTS\\n                              (dollars in millions)\\n\\nNote 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n---------------------------\\n\\nBasis of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the\\naccounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its subsidiaries.\\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily include\\nsecurities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase,\\nrecorded at cost, which approximates market.\\n\\nTime Deposits and Marketable Securities - Time deposits and marketable\\nsecurities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which\\napproximates cost.\\n\\nInventory Valuation - Inventories are generally stated at average cost, not\\nin excess of market.\\n\\nProperty and Depreciation - Expenditures for additions, renewals and\\nbetterments are capitalized at cost.  Depreciation is generally computed by\\nthe straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related\\nassets.  The range of annual rates used in computing provisions for\\ndepreciation is 2% to 20% for buildings and 5% to 33% for equipment.\\n\\nExcess of Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess of cost over net\\ntangible assets received in business acquisitions subsequent to October 31,\\n1970 is being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding\\n40 years.\\n\\nEarnings Per Share - Earnings per common share are computed using the\\nweighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.  The effect\\nof shares issuable under stock plans is not significant.\\n\\nNote 2  SPECIAL CHARGE\\n----------------------\\n\\nAs described in Note 18, the Company is party to a settlement concerning\\npending and future breast implant product liability claims (related to a\\npreviously discontinued business of a subsidiary) brought against it, its\\nMedical Engineering Corporation subsidiary, and certain other subsidiaries.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a special charge of $500\\nmillion before taxes, $310 million after taxes, or $.60 per share.  The\\ncharge consisted of $1.5 billion in anticipation of its share of the pending\\nsettlement and costs of the litigation ($1.4 billion recorded as a long-term\\nliability in Product Liability and $100 million recorded as a current\\nliability in Accrued Expenses), offset by $1 billion of expected insurance\\nproceeds (recorded as Insurance Recoverable).  Although the Company is\\ncurrently engaged in coverage litigation with certain of its insurers,\\nexpected insurance proceeds represent the amount of insurance which the\\nCompany considers appropriate to record as recoverable at this time.  The\\nCompany believes that ultimately it will obtain substantial additional\\namounts of insurance proceeds.\\n\\n\\n                                    31\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                           BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n                              (dollars in millions)\\n\\nVarious events occurred in 1994, including a number of claimants opting out\\nof the settlement.  Based upon preliminary analyses of the number of such\\nopt outs and of other issues, in the fourth quarter of 1994 the Company\\nrecorded a special charge to earnings of $750 million before taxes, $488\\nmillion after taxes, or $.96 per share ($320 million of which was recorded\\nas a current liability in Accrued Expenses).\\n\\nNote 3  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nIn August 1994, the Company acquired Matrix Essentials, Inc., the leading\\nmanufacturer in North America of professional hair care and beauty products\\nsold exclusively in beauty salons.  In connection with the acquisition, the\\nCompany issued 7,452,818 shares of common stock.\\n\\nIn September 1994, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining\\nownership interest in the UPSA Group, which develops and markets a wide\\nrange of nonprescription health and pharmaceutical products, including\\nanalgesics and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal specialties.  The Company\\nheld a minority stake in UPSA since 1990.\\n\\nIn January 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of Calgon Vestal\\nLaboratories, a skin care and infection control products business.\\n\\nIn April 1994, the Company completed the sale of Xomed-Treace, Inc., a\\nmanufacturer of specialty surgical products, to Merocel Corporation.\\n\\nIn July 1994, the Company sold Squibb Diagnostics, its diagnostic contrast\\nmedia and radiopharmaceuticals businesses, to Bracco S.p.A.  The Company\\nwill continue manufacturing certain diagnostic products, including ProHance\\nand Isovue, and nuclear medicine products.

The most significant of these are described below.\\n\\nBreast Implant Litigation\\n-------------------------\\n  As of December 31, 1994, approximately 20,000 plaintiffs have filed suit\\n  against the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation\\n  (MEC), and certain other subsidiaries, in federal and state courts and in\\n  certain Canadian provincial courts, alleging damages for personal\\n  injuries of various types resulting from polyurethane covered breast\\n  implants and smooth walled breast implants.  Most of these plaintiffs are\\n  participants in a class action settlement approved by the federal\\n  District Court in Birmingham, Alabama, and that settlement is now subject\\n  to appeals.  Of those who have chosen to opt out of the settlement, the\\n  Company estimates that approximately 3,000 United States claimants may\\n  assert claims based upon MEC implants.  Under the settlement, the Company\\n  would make payments totaling $1.154 billion over a period of 30 years.\\n  Note 2 sets forth the special charges recorded in connection with this\\n  litigation.  If the value of approved current disease claims under the\\n  settlement exceeds certain limits, payments to claimants would be reduced\\n  and claimants would have another opportunity to opt out of the\\n  settlement.  If this were to occur, the Company and other defendants\\n  could renegotiate the terms of the settlement or withdraw.  The Company\\n  is unable to predict when these events may occur but, based on\\n  information available at this time, it does not seem likely before late\\n  1995.  Dependent on these and other future developments, the Company\\n  would record such additional charge as may be required.  The amount of\\n  such a charge, if any, cannot be estimated.\\n\\nOther Actions\\n-------------\\n  The Company is a defendant in a number of actions brought against it and\\n  other pharmaceutical companies in federal and state courts by the\\n  children or grandchildren of women who ingested diethylstilbestrol (DES),\\n  a product which had been, but is no longer, manufactured or sold by an\\n  affiliate of the Company.\\n\\n                                    47\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                           BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n                              (dollars in millions)\\n\\n  The Company is a defendant in several state antitrust actions (some of\\n  which have been removed to federal court) filed on behalf of purported\\n  classes of individual purchasers of infant formula products, and by three\\n  state Attorneys General, alleging a conspiracy regarding pricing of\\n  infant formula products and other violations of state antitrust or\\n  deceptive trade practice laws and seeking treble damages, statutory and\\n  civil penalties and injunctive relief.  Five other state Attorneys\\n  General have commenced civil investigations of pricing practices and\\n  marketing activities in the infant formula industry.  The Canadian Bureau\\n  of Competition Policy has commenced a civil and criminal investigation of\\n  the Canadian infant formula market.  The Company is also a defendant in\\n  one federal court action filed by the State of Louisiana on behalf of\\n  indirect purchasers of infant formula alleging a conspiracy regarding\\n  pricing of infant formula products and seeking treble damages, civil\\n  penalties and injunctive relief.\\n\\n  As of December 31, 1994, the Company is a defendant in over 60 separate\\n  actions commenced against the Company and other pharmaceutical\\n  manufacturers, wholesalers and others in various federal district courts\\n  on behalf of certain chain pharmacies, supermarket chains and independent\\n  drug stores.  Plaintiffs\\' actions have been brought by drug retailers\\n  either on an individual basis or as representatives of nationwide classes\\n  of retail pharmacies.  These cases all seek treble damages in an as yet\\n  unspecified amount and injunctive relief on account of alleged antitrust\\n  violations in the pricing and marketing of brand-name prescription drugs.\\n  A class of retail pharmacists has been certified in the multi-district\\n  litigation and the individual claims have been coordinated for purposes\\n  of pre-trial proceedings.  State court cases brought under state law and\\n  alleging similar grounds are proceeding in California, Alabama and\\n  Wisconsin, but generally these actions are less advanced than the\\n  coordinated federal cases.\\n\\n  The Company has entered into a settlement of a class action filed in the\\n  United States District Court for the Southern District of New York\\n  alleging violations of federal securities laws and regulations in\\n  connection with, among other things, earnings projections.  The\\n  settlement is subject to approval by the Court.\\n\\n  The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved\\n  in, a number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection\\n  Agency or comparable state agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental\\n  Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or\\n  comparable state laws directed at the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.\\n\\n  While it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these\\n  cases, it is the opinion of management that these lawsuits, claims and\\n  proceedings which are pending against the Company are without merit or\\n  will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s operating\\n  results, liquidity or consolidated financial position.\\n\\n\\n                                    48\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                           BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n                 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\n\\n\\nNote 19  SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n                              First   Second    Third   Fourth\\n                            Quarter  Quarter  Quarter  Quarter      Year\\n                            -------  -------  -------  -------   -------\\n1994:\\nNet Sales                    $2,834   $2,970   $2,932   $3,248   $11,984\\nGross Profit                  2,089    2,228    2,172    2,373     8,862\\nNet Earnings*                   581      542      621       98     1,842\\nEarnings Per Common Share*     1.14     1.07     1.22      .19      3.62\\n\\n1993:\\nNet Sales                    $2,755   $2,802   $2,862   $2,994   $11,413\\nGross Profit                  2,014    2,085    2,099    2,186     8,384\\nNet Earnings*                   575      521      608      255     1,959\\nEarnings Per Common Share*     1.11     1.01     1.18      .50      3.80\\n\\n* The fourth quarter and annual results included a special charge of $750\\n  million ($488 million after taxes, or $.96 per share) in 1994 and $500\\n  million ($310 million after taxes, or $.60 per share) in 1993 for pending\\n  and future product liability claims.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    49\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS\\n                        ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nTo the Board of Directors\\nand Stockholders of\\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company\\n\\n\\n\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index\\nappearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 52 present fairly, in all\\nmaterial respects, the financial position of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\\nand its subsidiaries at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, and the results of\\ntheir operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity\\nwith generally accepted accounting principles.

Purpose of the Plan\\n   -------------------\\n   The purpose of this Plan is to provide benefits for certain employees\\nparticipating in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Savings and Investment\\nProgram (\"Savings and Investment Program\" or \"Program\") whose funded\\nbenefits are or will be limited by application of the Employee Retirement\\nIncome Security Act of 1974, as amended (the \"Code\").  The Plan is intended\\nto be an \"excess benefit plan\" as that term is defined in Section 3(36) of\\nERISA with respect to those participants whose benefits under the Program\\nhave been limited by Section 415 of the Code, and a \"top hat\" plan meeting\\nthe requirements of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), 401(a)(1) and 4021(b)(6) of\\nERISA with respect to those participants whose benefits under the Program\\nhave been limited by Section 401(a)(17) of the Code.  This Plan is a\\ncontinuation and successor plan to the Bristol-Myers Company and its\\nSubsidiary or Affiliated Corporations Participating in the Bristol-Myers\\nCompany Savings and Investment Program, as in effect on January 1, 1991 and\\nas amended thereafter (the \"Prior Plan\").  All amounts accrued under the\\nPrior Plan continue to be accrued under this Plan.\\n\\nII.  Administration of the Plan\\n     --------------------------\\n   The Savings Plan Committee (the \"Committee\") appointed by the Board of\\nDirectors of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the \"Company\") to administer the\\nSavings and Investment Program shall also administer this Plan.  The\\nCommittee shall have full authority to determine all questions arising in\\nconnection with the Plan, including its interpretation, may adopt\\nprocedural rules, and may employ and rely on such legal counsel, such\\nactuaries, such accountants and such agents as it may deem advisable to\\nassist in the administration of the Plan.  Decisions of the Committee shall\\nbe conclusive and binding on all persons.\\n\\n\\nIII. Participation in the Plan\\n     -------------------------\\n   Each participant in the Savings and Investment Program who is employed\\nby a corporation participating in the Program (hereinafter referred to as a\\n\"participating employer\" which term also includes the Company) shall be\\neligible to participate in this Plan whenever (a) the allocation to his\\naccount under the Savings and Investment Program, as from time to time in\\neffect, would exceed the limitations on benefits and contributions imposed\\nby Section 415 of the Code calculated from and after September 2, 1974 or\\n(b) amounts of his compensation would be excluded from his \"Annual Benefit\\nSalary or Wages\" determined under the Program by reason of the application\\nof Section 401(a)(17) of the Code.\\n\\n                                    E-2-1\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. Equalization Benefits Related to the Savings and\\n    ------------------------------------------------\\n    Investment Program\\n    ------------------\\n   A.  A participant shall be entitled to equalization benefits under this\\nPlan only for those plan years in which (a) he has elected to have a\\npercentage of his Annual Benefit Salary or Wages contributed on his behalf\\nto the Program and (b) he also has in effect an election, made prior to the\\nyear with respect to which such contributions relate, to defer a specified\\npercentage of his Annual Benefit Salary or Wages and to have such amount\\ncredited to this Plan in the manner described in paragraphs B and C of this\\nArticle IV.\\n\\n   B.  The participating employer that employs a participant meeting the\\nrequirements of Paragraph A for a plan year shall credit, or shall cause to\\nbe credited, a book account to record the amount of such participant\\'s\\nAnnual Benefit Salary or Wages that he has elected to have credited to this\\nPlan, commencing at the time such participant is precluded from having\\nadditional contributions made to his accounts under the Savings and\\nInvestment Program because of the limitations of Section 415 of the Code,\\nand continuing through the end of the plan year.  Such participating\\nemployer shall also credit, or cause to be credited, a book account to\\nrecord the amount of \"Employing Company contributions\", if any, that would\\nhave been contributed on such participant\\'s behalf for such plan year to\\nthe Program pursuant to the terms of the Program had the amount of the\\nparticipant\\'s Annual Benefit Salary or Wages credited pursuant to this\\nparagraph B been instead contributed to the Program.\\n\\n   C.  The participating employer that employs a participant meeting the\\nrequirements of paragraph A for a plan year shall also credit, or cause to\\nbe credited, a separate book account to record the amount of such\\nparticipant\\'s Annual Benefit Salary or Wages that he has elected to have\\ncredited to this Plan, commencing at the time such participant is precluded\\nfrom having additional contributions made to his accounts under the Savings\\nand Investment Program because of the limitations of Section 401(a)(17) of\\nthe Code, and continuing until the end of the plan year or, if sooner, the\\ntime amounts begin to be credited to the participant\\'s book account under\\nthe Plan pursuant to the first sentence of paragraph B for such plan year.\\nNo participant may earn credits under both this paragraph C and under\\nparagraph B at the same time; whenever possible, credits shall be made\\npursuant to paragraph B prior to this paragraph C.  Such participating\\nemployer shall also credit, or cause to be credited, a book account to\\nrecord the amount of \"Employing Company contributions\", if any, that would\\nhave been contributed on such participant\\'s behalf for such plan year to\\nthe Program pursuant to the terms of the Program had the amount of the\\nparticipant\\'s Annual Benefit Salary or Wages credited pursuant to this\\nparagraph C been instead contributed to the Program.\\n\\n   D.  The election to have amounts credited to this Plan may be suspended\\nat the participant\\'s option during any period of time that the participant\\nestablishes to the satisfaction of the Committee that he is undergoing a\\nfinancial hardship as defined in Article VI of this Plan.\\n\\n\\n                                    E-2-2\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n   E.  Prior to October 1, 1994 each participant shall be given the\\nopportunity to elect to have credits to his account made on or after\\nOctober 1, 1994 deemed to be invested in any one or a combination of the\\ninvestment funds being offered under the Savings and Investment Program on\\nor after October 1, 1994 (other than the Company Stock Fund) in 1%\\nincrements.  In the event a participant fails to make such an election, all\\nsuch credits shall be deemed to be invested in the investment funds as\\ndetermined by the Committee to be most closely resembling the investment\\nfunds the participant had elected with respect to the credits to his\\nAccount made prior to October 1, 1994; provided, however, that where a\\nparticipant\\'s existing investment directions had allocated one-third (33\\n1/3%) of his Account to each of the three investment funds in existence on\\nSeptember 30, 1994 (other than the Company Stock Fund), the equivalent\\nallocation shall be deemed to be 33%, 33% and 34%, with 34% allocated to\\nthe least volatile investment fund (as determined by the Committee) which\\nmost closely resembles the least volatile investment fund which the\\nparticipant had elected prior to October 1, 1994.\\n\\n   Effective as of the close of business on September 30, 1994 (or as soon\\nas practicable thereafter), each participant\\'s book account shall be\\nrevalued as if the credits to his account representing a type of investment\\nunder the Plan was reduced to cash (other than any credits representing a\\ndeemed investment in the Fixed Income Fund) and reinvested in each\\ninvestment fund or funds being offered on or after October 1, 1994 under\\nthe Savings and Investment Program (other than the Company Stock Fund) as\\ndetermined by the Committee to most closely resemble the respective\\ninvestment fund in which such credits were deemed invested prior to October\\n1, 1994.\\n\\n   On and after October 1, 1994, on any business day the participant may,\\npursuant to telephonic notification with the administrative agent of the\\nCommittee (the \"Administrative Agent\"), (i) elect to have future credits\\ndeemed to be invested, in 1% increments, among such funds established under\\nthe Savings and Investment Program, other than the Company Stock Fund,\\neffective as of the first day of the next payroll period (or as soon as\\npracticable thereafter) and (ii) elect that the credits to his account\\nunder this Article IV representing any type of investment under the Plan be\\ndeemed to be reduced to cash (in 1% increments) and that such deemed cash\\nbe invested in such other funds which the participant shall designate in\\nsuch election, effective as of the next business day (or as soon as\\npracticable thereafter).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no election under\\nclause (ii) above with respect to credits accrued prior to October 1, 1994\\nwill be accepted during the period beginning on September 27, 1994 and\\nending on or about November 30, 1994 (or as soon as practicable\\nthereafter).  Any investment election given by a participant shall continue\\nin effect until changed by the participant.  To the extent a participant\\nmakes no election, all such credits shall be deemed to have been invested\\nin the same manner and in the same proportion as elected by the participant\\nwith respect to allotments credited to his account under the Savings and\\nInvestment Program (and any changes in such investment elections), except\\nthat any election (or change in election) to invest in the Company Stock\\nFund shall not be honored and such credits shall be deemed invested in\\nequal amounts in such other funds unless the participant has not elected to\\nhave any amounts invested in such other funds, in which case such credits\\nshall be deemed invested in the Fixed Income Fund established under such\\nProgram.  Such book accounts shall be revalued each business day as if they\\nhad been so invested.\\n                                    E-2-3\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nFor purposes of this Plan, \"telephonic notification\" shall include any form\\nof communication acceptable to the Administrative Agent, including,\\ntelephone, telegraph, satellite or other wireless communication.  A\\n\"business day\" shall mean any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for\\nbusiness.\\n\\n   F.  Each participating employer shall distribute to each participant in\\nthis Plan employed by it for whom it maintains book accounts or his\\nbeneficiary designated under this Plan or, if no such designation is made,\\nunder the Savings and Investment Program, upon the termination of\\nemployment of such participant an amount in cash equal to (i) the value of\\nhis book accounts attributable to credits to his account respecting\\nallotments and deemed earnings and appreciation thereon and (ii) the same\\npercentage of the value of his book accounts attributable to the deemed\\ncontributions of the participating employer as the percentage of his\\naccount balance under the Savings and Investment Program which is vested at\\nthe time of termination of his employment less (iii) the amount of any\\ndistribution for financial hardship made pursuant to Section VI.  Such\\ndistribution shall be payable to the participant or his beneficiary in the\\nsame form as the participant\\'s benefit under the Savings and Investment\\nProgram is payable (utilizing, if applicable, the same actuarial\\nassumptions used to compute the participant\\'s Savings and Investment\\nProgram benefit payments or such other assumptions as may be determined by\\nthe Committee from time to time).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no\\ndistribution or withdrawal will be processed during the period beginning on\\nSeptember 27, 1994 and ending on or about November 30, 1994 (or as soon as\\npracticable thereafter) under the Program and such distribution shall be\\nmade as soon as feasible thereafter.\\n\\nV. Designation of Beneficiaries in the Event of Death\\n   --------------------------------------------------\\n   A participant may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive\\nall or part of the amount of his account in case of his death if such\\nbeneficiary or beneficiaries shall be living at the time of his death;\\nprovided, however, that if the participant has elected to have his benefit\\nunder the Savings and Investment Program paid in the form of a \"qualified\\njoint and survivor annuity,\" then the participant\\'s beneficiary shall be\\nhis spouse.  A participant may, subject to the preceding sentence, change\\nor revoke a designation of beneficiary and such designation, change or\\nrevocation shall be on a form to be provided for the purpose and shall be\\nsigned by the participant and delivered to his employing corporation prior\\nto his death.  In case of the death of the participant, the amount of his\\naccount with respect to which a designation of beneficiary has been made\\n(to the extent it is valid and enforceable under applicable law) shall be\\ndistributed in accordance with this Plan to the surviving designated\\nbeneficiary or beneficiaries.  The amount in the participant\\'s account\\ndistributable upon death and not subject to such designation, or if no\\nbeneficiary shall be living at the time of the participant\\'s death, shall\\nbe distributed following his death to the person or persons in the first of\\nthe following classes of successive preference:\\n\\n1.

Substantially\\nall such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of\\nany one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany.\\n                                    -  2  -\\n<PAGE>\\nPATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES\\n- --------------------------------\\nThe Company owns or is licensed under a number of patents in the United States\\nand foreign countries covering products, principally in the pharmaceutical\\nproducts and medical devices segments, and has also developed many brand names\\nand trademarks for products in each industry segment.  The Company considers\\nthe overall protection of its patent, trademark and license rights to be of\\nmaterial value and acts to protect these rights from infringement.  The Company\\nbelieves that, except for the patent relating to captopril which expires in the\\nUnited States and Germany in 1995, no single patent or license is of material\\nimportance in relation to the business as a whole.\\n\\n\\nCOMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS\\n- ---------------------------------------\\nThe markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad based,\\nheavily competitive and include many competitors.  The principal means of\\ncompetition utilized to market the products of Bristol-Myers Squibb include\\nquality, service, price and product performance.  The products of the\\npharmaceutical products segment and the medical devices segment are promoted on\\na national and international basis in medical journals and directly to the\\nmedical profession.  Most of the other products of Bristol-Myers Squibb are\\ngenerally advertised and promoted on a national and international basis through\\nthe use of television, radio, print media, consumer offers, and window and\\nin-store displays.  Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s products are principally sold to the\\nwholesale and retail trade both nationally and internationally.  Certain\\nproducts of the pharmaceutical products and medical devices segments are also\\nsold to other drug manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession.  None\\nof the segments is dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, such\\nthat the loss of any one or more would have a material adverse effect on the\\nsegment.\\n\\n\\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\\n- ------------------------\\nResearch and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s businesses,\\nparticularly to the pharmaceutical products segment.  Management continues to\\nplace great emphasis on these activities.  Pharmaceutical research and\\ndevelopment is carried out by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research\\nInstitute which has major facilities in Princeton and New Brunswick, New\\nJersey, Wallingford, Connecticut and Seattle, Washington.  Pharmaceutical\\nresearch and development is also carried out at various other facilities in the\\nUnited States and in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United\\nKingdom.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,128 million in 1993, $1,083 million in 1992 and\\n$983 million in 1991 on company sponsored research and development activities.\\nPharmaceutical research and development spending, as a percentage of\\npharmaceutical sales, increased to 14.9% in 1993 from 14.8% in 1992 and 14.3%\\nin 1991.\\n\\n\\nREGULATION\\n- ----------\\nMost aspects of the Company\\'s business are subject to some degree of government\\nregulation in the countries in which its operations are conducted.  The\\nCompany\\'s policy is to comply fully with all regulatory requirements applying\\nto its products and operations.  For some products, and in some countries,\\n                                    -  3  -\\n<PAGE>\\ngovernment regulation is significant and, in general, there is a trend to more\\nstringent regulation.  The Company devotes significant time, effort and expense\\naddressing the extensive governmental regulatory requirements applicable to its\\nbusiness.  Governmental regulatory actions can result in the recall or seizure\\nof products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the\\nproduction or sale of a product, and other civil and criminal sanctions.\\n\\nIn the United States, the drug, medical device, diagnostic, food and cosmetic\\nindustries in which the Company operates have long been subject to regulation\\nby various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as to product\\nmanufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.  Assuring compliance\\nwith appropriate laws and regulations requires increasing expenditures of time\\nand resources.\\n\\nIn addition, governmental bodies in the United States as well as other\\ncountries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care and, in\\nsome cases, have focused attention on the pricing of drugs and on appropriate\\ndrug utilization.  Government regulation in these areas already exists in some\\ncountries and may be expanded significantly in the United States and other\\ncountries in the future.\\n\\nWhile the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may be\\naffected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its substantial\\nexperience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and restrictions\\non its operations throughout the world and its development of new and improved\\nproducts should enable it to compete effectively within this environment.\\n\\n\\nEMPLOYEES\\n- ---------\\nBristol-Myers Squibb employed approximately 49,500 people at December 31, 1993.\\n\\n\\nDOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS\\n- -------------------------------\\nReference is made to Note 17 Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual\\nReport.\\n\\nInternational operations are subject to certain risks which are inherent in\\nconducting business abroad, including possible nationalization or\\nexpropriation, price and exchange controls, limitations on foreign\\nparticipation in local enterprises and other restrictive governmental actions.\\nIn addition, changes in the relative value of currencies take place from time\\nto time and their effects may be favorable or unfavorable on Bristol-Myers\\nSquibb\\'s operations.  There are currency restrictions relating to repatriation\\nof earnings in certain countries.\\n\\n\\nItem 2.  PROPERTIES.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb\\'s world headquarters is located at 345 Park Avenue, New\\nYork, New York, where it leases approximately 841,800 square feet of floor\\nspace, approximately 225,700 square feet of which is sublet to others.  The\\nCompany\\'s pharmaceutical world headquarters is located in Princeton, New\\nJersey.  Other major domestic pharmaceutical facilities are located in\\nEvansville, Indiana, New Brunswick and Plainsboro, New Jersey and Buffalo and\\nSyracuse, New York.  The Company\\'s major domestic medical devices facilities\\n                                    -  4  -\\n<PAGE>\\nare located in Warsaw, Indiana, Skillman, New Jersey and Greensboro, North\\nCarolina.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb manufactures products at forty-one major worldwide\\nlocations with an aggregate floor space of approximately 11,027,200 square\\nfeet.  Thirty-nine are owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb and two facilities are\\nleased.  The U.S. manufacturing facilities total seventeen, of which 42% and\\n29% are used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and medical devices,\\nrespectively.  The non-U.S. operations include a total of twenty-four major\\nowned manufacturing facilities, of which 79% and 4% are used in the manufacture\\nof pharmaceutical products and medical devices, respectively.  These facilities\\nare located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany,\\nIreland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Taiwan,\\nthe United Kingdom and Venezuela, and aggregate approximately 5,929,000 square\\nfeet of space.\\n\\nPortions of these facilities and other facilities owned or leased by\\nBristol-Myers Squibb in the United States and elsewhere are used for research,\\nadministration, storage and distribution.  All of Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s\\nfacilities are well-maintained, adequately insured and in satisfactory\\ncondition.\\n\\nCapital expenditures for the construction, expansion and modernization of\\nproduction, research and administrative facilities aggregrated $580 million,\\n$654 million and $633 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.\\n\\n\\nItem 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\\n\\nDES LITIGATION\\n- --------------\\nThe Company is a defendant in a number of actions brought against it and other\\npharmaceutical companies in federal and state courts by the children or\\ngrandchildren of women who ingested diethylstibelstrol (DES), a product which\\nhad been, but is no longer, manufactured or sold by a subsidiary of the\\nCompany.  The Company believes that these actions will not have a material\\nadverse effect on the Company\\'s consolidated financial position.\\n\\nBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION\\n- -------------------------\\nApproximately 11,000 plaintiffs have filed suit against the Company, its\\nsubsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation (\"MEC\"), and certain other\\nsubsidiaries, in federal and state courts and in Canadian provincial courts,\\nalleging damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from\\npolyurethane covered breast implants and smooth walled breast implants.\\nCertain of these cases are class actions which seek to allege claims on behalf\\nof all breast implant recipients.  All federal court actions have been\\nconsolidated for pre-trial proceedings in federal district court in Birmingham,\\nAlabama.\\n\\nIn late March 1994, the Company, other defendants and certain plaintiffs\\nentered into a settlement agreement regarding all pending and future breast\\nimplant product liability claims brought in the United States against certain\\ndefendants, including the Company, MEC and certain other subsidiaries.  The\\nsettlement agreement must be submitted for approval to the Hon. Sam C. Pointer,\\nthe federal judge who is presiding over the proceedings in Birmingham, Alabama.\\nThereafter, the settlement would not become final until the resolution of any\\nappeals of Judge Pointer\\'s approval.  Claimants are entitled\\n                                    -  5  -\\n<PAGE>\\nto opt out of the settlement and pursue litigation rather than participate in\\nthe settlement.  The settlement is also dependent on claimants not opting out\\nin significant numbers.  The settlement provides for the creation of a series\\nof claims funds to which the settling defendants would contribute various\\namounts over approximately 30 years.  The aggregate contribution to be made by\\nthe Company, MEC and certain other subsidiaries shall be no more than $1.154\\nbillion.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a special charge of $500\\nmillion before taxes ($310 million after taxes) in connection with pending and\\nfuture breast implant product liability claims (See Item 8 of this Report).\\nThe special charge consists of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and\\nexpenses, offset by $1 billion of expected insurance proceeds.  Although the\\nCompany is currently engaged in coverage litigation with certain of its\\ninsurers, such expected insurance proceeds represent the amount of insurance\\nwhich the Company considers appropriate to record as recoverable at this time.\\nThe Company believes that ultimately it will obtain substantial additional\\namounts of insurance proceeds.  Based on the amounts and timing of the payment\\nobligations under the settlement, the Company\\'s current estimate of potential\\nliabilities and expenses that may not be covered by the settlement, and the\\namount of insurance proceeds that the Company believes will ultimately be\\navailable, the Company believes that the breast implant actions will not have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\\'s consolidated financial position.\\n\\nPATENT PROCEEDINGS\\n- ------------------\\nIn September 1992, the Company brought an action in the United States District\\nCourt for the Southern District of New York against Danbury Pharmacal, Inc. for\\npatent infringement following Danbury\\'s filing of an Abbreviated New Drug\\nApplication which asserted that one of the Company\\'s patents for buspirone\\n(sold under the brand name BUSPAR*) is invalid and unenforceable.  On June 30,\\n1993, the District Court granted Danbury\\'s Summary Judgment motion invalidating\\nthe Company\\'s U.S. Patent No. 4,182,763.  The Company appealed the District\\nCourt\\'s decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and awaits the\\nappellate decision.  The Company believes that the District Court\\'s decision\\nwas erroneous as a matter of fact and law and that the Company will prevail on\\nits appeal.\\n\\nIn 1991, Zenith Laboratories, Inc. brought an action in the United States\\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey in which Zenith sought a\\ndeclaratory judgment that its cefadroxil product does not infringe the\\nCompany\\'s patent for cefadroxil monohydrate.  In July 1992, following a trial,\\nthe District Court issued a decision finding that the Company\\'s patent for\\ncefadroxil monohydrate (sold under the brand name DURICEF*) would be infringed\\nby Zenith\\'s cefadroxil DC.  The District Court ordered that the effective date\\nof Zenith\\'s FDA approvals for cefadroxil DC capsules and tablets shall not be\\nearlier than March 12, 2002, the expiration date of the Company\\'s cefadroxil\\nmonohydrate patent.  Zenith appealed the District Court\\'s decision to the Court\\nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and on March 24, 1994 the Court of Appeals\\nreversed the District Court\\'s decision and held that, based on the evidence\\nbefore it, the District Court erred in finding that Zenith\\'s product infringes\\nthe Company\\'s patent.  The Company will ask the Court of Appeals either to\\nreconsider its decision or remand the case to the District Court for further\\nconsideration.\\n\\nINFANT FORMULA MATTERS\\n- ----------------------\\nThe Company, one of its subsidiaries and others are defendants in ten antitrust\\n                                    -  6  -\\n<PAGE>\\nactions in seven states (Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Texas\\nand Wisconsin) filed on behalf of purported statewide classes of indirect\\npurchasers of infant formula products and by the Attorney General of Texas,\\nalleging a conspiracy regarding pricing of infant formula products and other\\nviolations of state antitrust or deceptive trade practices laws and seeking\\ntreble damages, statutory and civil penalties and injunctive and other relief.\\nIn one of the Texas actions, the trial court\\'s dismissal of an amended class\\naction complaint of certain indirect purchasers has been reversed and remanded.\\nIn one of the Alabama actions, the plaintiffs\\' appeal of the denial of their\\nmotion for class certification was withdrawn.  In addition, the State of\\nLouisiana has filed a federal court action against the Company and others\\nasserting claims similar to those previously asserted by the State of Florida\\nand dismissed by the federal court in the Northern District of Florida.  The\\nState of Louisiana\\'s case has been transferred for pre-trial purposes to the\\nNorthern District of Florida where a motion to dismiss is pending.  The Nestle\\nFood Company has filed an action in federal court in the Central District of\\nCalifornia against the Company, one of its subsidiaries and others alleging\\nthat the defendants conspired to restrain competition in and maintain\\nartificial barriers to entry into the United States infant formula market and\\nengaged in other violations of federal and state antitrust or other laws.\\nThere are pending investigations of infant formula pricing and marketing by\\nfive state Attorneys General, and the office of the Attorney General of New\\nJersey has indicated its intention to begin a similar investigation.  The\\nCanadian Bureau of Competition Policy has commenced a civil inquiry, and is\\ncontemplating a criminal inquiry, into alleged anticompetitive practices among\\nthe Company and certain other members of the Canadian infant formula industry.\\nThe Company believes that the foregoing matters are without merit and that\\ntheir ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany\\'s consolidated financial position.\\n\\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRICING LITIGATION\\n- ---------------------------------\\nThe Company, along with more than 30 other major pharmaceutical manufacturers\\nand drug wholesalers, is a defendant in a number of actions brought in various\\nfederal courts around the country seeking damages and injunctive relief under\\nthe federal antitrust laws for alleged antitrust violations in the pricing and\\nmarketing of brand name prescription drugs.  In  addition, the Company, along\\nwith several other pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers and a pharmacy\\nbenefit management company, has been named as a defendant in several actions\\nfiled in California state courts, which involve substantially similar factual\\nallegations as those made in the federal actions.  These lawsuits are of three\\ndifferent varieties:  (1) individual actions by independent retail pharmacies;\\n(2) purported class actions by independent pharmacies seeking to represent a\\nclass comprised of those alleged to be similarly situated; and (3) individual\\nactions by large retail pharmacy chains and supermarkets.  The federal court\\ncases, along with additional cases making similar claims but not naming the\\nCompany as a defendant, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the\\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  These\\ncases are still in the pleading stage and no discovery has commenced.  The\\nCompany believes that these actions are without merit and that their ultimate\\ndisposition will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s\\nconsolidated financial position.\\n\\nSECURITIES LITIGATION\\n- ---------------------\\nThe Company is a defendant in a purported class action filed in the U.S.\\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violations of\\nfederal securities laws and regulations in connection with, among other things,\\n                                    -  7  -\\n<PAGE>\\nearnings projections.  The Court has certified this action as a class action on\\nbehalf of all persons (other than defendants) who purchased or otherwise\\nacquired shares of the Company\\'s common stock between November 18, 1991 and\\nJune 2, 1992.  The Company believes that this action will not have a material\\nadverse effect on the Company\\'s consolidated financial position.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\\n- ---------------------\\nThe Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in, a\\nnumber of proceedings brought by federal or state environmental agencies under\\nthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act\\n(CERCLA or Superfund), or State laws analogous to CERCLA, or to statutes and\\nregulations which otherwise deal with cleanup of contaminated property.  The\\nCompany believes that these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect\\non the Company\\'s consolidated financial position.\\n\\n\\nItem 4.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\\n         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n- -------\\nDuring 1993, Bristol-Myers Squibb\\'s worldwide sales of $11.4 billion increased\\n2% over the prior year. Domestic sales increased 4%, while international sales\\nremained at prior year levels (a 5% increase excluding the unfavorable effect\\nof foreign currency translation).\\n\\nEarnings from continuing operations, excluding the 1993 special charge and a\\n1992 restructuring charge, increased 8% to $2,269 million and 8% to $4.40 per\\nshare. Including these charges, earnings from continuing operations were $1,959\\nmillion, or $3.80 per share, in 1993 and $1,538 million, or $2.97 per share, in\\n1992.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 1993, a special charge of $500 million before taxes,\\n$310 million after taxes, or $.60 per share, was recorded in connection with\\npending and future breast implant product liability claims against the Company,\\nits subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation, and certain other\\nsubsidiaries. The special charge consists of $1.5 billion for potential\\nliabilities and expenses related to breast implant claims, offset by $1 billion\\nof expected insurance proceeds. This special charge is further discussed in\\nNote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of\\nthis Form 10-K Annual Report.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 1992, a charge of $890 million before taxes, $570\\nmillion after taxes, or $1.10 per share, was recorded in connection with\\nvarious restructuring actions taken by the Company to strengthen its four core\\nbusinesses in recognition of changing worldwide health care trends. This charge\\nprimarily covered the costs of reducing employment levels, including a\\nvoluntary retirement program for the Company\\'s U.S. employees, and streamlining\\nworldwide production and distribution operations.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb\\'s financial position remains strong. At December 31, 1993,\\nthe Company held $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and\\nmarketable securities, and working capital increased to $3.5 billion from $3.3\\nbillion at December 31, 1992 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 1991. Cash\\nprovided by operating activities increased to $2.6 billion in 1993 from $2.0\\nbillion and $1.8 billion in 1992 and 1991, respectively, and continued to\\nfinance research, new product development and introductions, capital spending\\nand working capital needs, as well as increased dividend payments. In 1993,\\ndividends per common share were $2.88, an increase of 4% over 1992. In December\\n1993, an additional dividend increase of 1.4% was announced, with a 1994\\nindicated annual payment of $2.92. With this payment, Bristol-Myers Squibb\\ndividends will have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% over the\\npast 10 years.  This increase represents the 22nd consecutive year that the\\nCompany has raised the dividend on its common stock.\\n\\nBristol-Myers Squibb\\'s strong financial position is further evidenced by its\\nability to maintain a triple A credit rating, a substantial unused borrowing\\ncapacity, a return on stockholders\\' equity of 32.8% in 1993 and a low long-term\\ndebt to equity ratio.\\n                                   -  18  -\\n<PAGE>\\nNET SALES AND EARNINGS\\n- ----------------------\\nWorldwide sales increased 2% in 1993 to $11.4 billion, compared to increases of\\n6% and 9% in 1992 and 1991, respectively. The 1993 consolidated sales growth\\nresulted from a 3% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to pricing, offset\\nin part by a 3% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency\\ntranslation. Domestic sales increased 4%, while international sales remained at\\nprior year levels (a 5% increase excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign\\ncurrency translation). In 1992, the 6% increase in sales reflected a 4%\\nincrease due to pricing, a 1% increase due to volume and a 1% increase due to\\nthe favorable effect of foreign currency translation. Domestic operations,\\nwhich were adversely affected by actions taken by wholesalers in 1992 to reduce\\ntheir inventories of pharmaceuticals, reported sales growth of 1% in 1992\\ncompared to 10% in 1991, while international operations reported sales growth\\nof 12% and 7% in 1992 and 1991, respectively.\\n\\nIn 1993, earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were $1,959\\nmillion and $3.80 per share, respectively, compared to $1,538 million and $2.97\\nper share in 1992 and $1,991 million and $3.82 per share in 1991. Excluding the\\n1993 special charge and the 1992 restructuring charge, earnings from continuing\\noperations increased 8% to $2,269 million and 8% to $4.40 per share in 1993.\\n\\nThe effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before\\nincome taxes was 23.8% in 1993 compared to 22.6% in 1992. Excluding the special\\ncharge in 1993 and the restructuring charge in 1992, the effective income tax\\nrates were 26.1% and 26.7%, respectively, compared to 28.5% in 1991, reflecting\\nthe continued benefit of increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. As a\\nresult of changes approved in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993,\\nthe Company estimates that its effective tax rate will increase in 1994 to\\napproximately 30.0%.\\n\\n\\nEXPENSES\\n- --------\\nTotal costs and expenses, excluding the 1993 special charge of $500 million and\\nthe 1992 restructuring charge of $890 million, were 73.1% of sales in 1993\\ncompared to 74.2% in 1992 and 73.7% in 1991. As a percentage of sales, cost of\\nproducts sold increased in 1993 to 26.5% from 25.6% in 1992 and 25.7% in 1991,\\nprimarily as a result of higher manufacturing costs of newer pharmaceutical\\nproducts.\\n\\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,\\ndecreased to 27.1% in 1993 from 27.6% in 1992 and 27.9% in 1991. The decline in\\n1993 reflects reductions in selling expenses, primarily in the U.S., and the\\nCompany\\'s ongoing commitment to contain administrative costs.\\n\\nThe level of advertising and promotion in support of new and existing products\\nwas $1,255 million in 1993 compared to $1,291 million in 1992 and $1,263\\nmillion in 1991. The decline in 1993 reflects lower expenditures in the\\nnonprescription health and pharmaceutical products segments, offset in part by\\nincreased spending in the toiletries and beauty aids segment.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s investment in research and development expenses reached over $1.1\\nbillion, an increase of 4% over 1992. In 1991, research and development\\nexpenses were $983 million. The increase each year reflects the Company\\'s\\ncontinued commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and\\n                                   -  19  -\\n<PAGE>\\nclinical development in support of newer products. Over the last 10 years,\\nresearch and development spending has increased nearly fourfold, resulting in a\\ncompound annual growth rate of 14%. Pharmaceutical research and development\\nspending, as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, increased to 14.9% in 1993\\nfrom 14.8% in 1992 and 14.3% in 1991.\\n\\n\\nINDUSTRY SEGMENTS\\n- -----------------\\nBy the end of 1993, Bristol-Myers Squibb had 27 products with more than $100\\nmillion in annual sales, including products from all four of the Company\\'s\\nindustry segments.\\n\\nIn 1993, sales in the PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS SEGMENT, which represents the\\nlargest segment at 57% of total company sales, increased 3% to $6,524 million.\\nThe worldwide sales growth resulted from a 5% increase due to volume and a 1%\\nincrease due to pricing, offset in part by a 3% decrease due to the unfavorable\\neffect of foreign currency translation. Domestic sales increased 11% primarily\\ndue to the Company\\'s newer products, while international sales decreased 4% (a\\n2% increase excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation).\\nSales of cardiovascular drugs, the largest product group in the segment at $2.6\\nbillion, were 2% below prior year levels. Captopril, an angiotensin converting\\nenzyme (ACE) inhibitor and the Company\\'s largest selling product, is sold\\nprimarily under the trademark CAPOTEN* (the patent for which expires in the\\nU.S. and Germany in 1995). Sales of captopril decreased 11% to $1.5 billion as\\na result of unfavorable foreign currency translation, a decline in U.S. market\\nshare and reduced sales in certain European countries reflecting restrictive\\ngovernment cost-containment measures. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) approved CAPOTEN* for a novel and expanded use following\\nheart attacks in patients with impaired function of the left ventricle.\\nPRAVACHOL*, the Company\\'s newer cholesterol-lowering agent with worldwide sales\\nexceeding $500 million, and MONOPRIL*, a second generation ACE inhibitor with\\nonce-a-day dosage, performed exceptionally well, with strong volume growth in\\nthe U.S. and in overseas markets. U.S. sales of nadolol, a beta blocker sold\\nprimarily under the trademark CORGARD* (the patent for which expired in the\\nU.S. in September 1993), remained at prior year levels. Sales of the Company\\'s\\nanti-infectives increased 2% to over $1.5 billion as increases in CEFZIL*, an\\noral cephalosporin antibiotic, VIDEX*, an antiretroviral agent for patients\\nwith AIDS or HIV disease, and DURICEF*, a broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin\\nantibiotic, were offset in part by declines in AMIKIN*, which is experiencing\\ngeneric competition, and in AZACTAM*. The Company\\'s line of anti-cancer agents\\nwas the fastest growing product group in the segment, strengthening the\\nCompany\\'s leadership position in cancer therapy. In 1993, sales of anti-cancer\\nagents increased 19% to $1.2 billion. Introductory sales of TAXOL*, the\\nCompany\\'s anti-cancer agent approved in the U.S. and Canada in December 1992\\nfor treatment of patients with ovarian cancer whose first-line or subsequent\\nchemotherapy has failed, were strong. In the latter part of 1993, TAXOL*\\nreceived clearance for marketing in a number of countries in Europe, Latin\\nAmerica and the Pacific area. Increased sales of VEPESID* (the patent for which\\nexpired in the U.S. in November 1993), PARAPLATIN* and PLATINOL* also\\ncontributed to the growth of anti-cancer agents. Central nervous system drug\\nsales increased 7%, reflecting domestic growth in sales of BUSPAR*, the\\nCompany\\'s novel anti-anxiety agent, and STADOL NS*, a prescription nasal spray\\nanalgesic. In the area of dermatological drugs, the Company received FDA\\napproval in December 1993 to market DOVONEX*, a vitamin D3 analogue for the\\ntreatment of moderate psoriasis. Sales of diagnostic agents were below prior\\nyear levels primarily due to ISOVUE*.\\n                                   -  20  -\\n<PAGE>\\nIn 1992, pharmaceutical products segment sales increased 7%, with a 4% increase\\ndue to pricing, a 2% increase due to volume and a 1% increase due to the\\nfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. Increases in sales of\\nCAPOTEN*, PRAVACHOL*, MONOPRIL*, CEFZIL*, VIDEX*, PARAPLATIN* and VEPESID* were\\nthe primary contributors to sales growth. In 1991, sales in the segment\\nincreased 12% primarily as a result of increased cardiovascular,\\nanti-infective, anti-cancer and central nervous system drug sales.\\n\\nOperating profit margin in 1993 was 32.7% compared to 31.0% in 1992, excluding\\nthe 1992 charge of $371 million for restructuring pharmaceutical operations.\\nThe increase in 1993 resulted from reductions in selling and advertising\\nexpenses, offset in part by higher manufacturing costs of newer pharmaceutical\\nproducts. In 1992, operating profit margin of 31.0%, excluding the\\nrestructuring charge, was lower than the 31.2% reported in 1991 due to\\nincreased selling and promotion expenses for the Company\\'s new and existing\\nproducts.\\n\\nSales in the MEDICAL DEVICES SEGMENT increased 2% in 1993 to $1,693 million,\\nreflecting a 3% increase due to pricing, a 1% increase due to volume and a 2%\\ndecrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.\\nDomestic sales remained at prior year levels, while international sales\\nincreased 4% (9% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency\\ntranslation). Worldwide sales of prosthetic implants increased 5%, led by the\\nInsall/Burstein II Modular Total Knee System, the MGII* Total Knee System and\\nthe CENTRALIGN* Precoat Hip Prosthesis. As a result, the Company continues to\\nmaintain the number one market position worldwide in both the hip and knee\\nprostheses markets. Sales of ostomy products increased 2% (11% excluding the\\nunfavorable effect of foreign currency translation) primarily due to volume\\ngrowth of the ACTIVE LIFE/COLODRESS* and the SUR-FIT/COMBIHESIVE* product lines\\nin the U.S. and in international markets. During 1993, the Company introduced\\nACTIVE LIFE FLUSHAWAY*, a one-piece, closed-end flushable pouch. In the\\nCompany\\'s line of wound care products, sales increased as a result of strong\\nvolume growth in international markets and the launch of several new DUODERM*\\nproducts in the U.S. Sales of the Company\\'s arthroscopy products increased due\\nto the strong performances of orthopaedic reconstructive systems and power\\ncutting instruments. In the Company\\'s line of fracture management products, the\\nCompany introduced COLLAGRAFT* Bone Graft Matrix, an alternative to using bone\\ngraft materials from donor bone stock or harvested from the patient.\\n\\nIn 1992, worldwide sales of medical devices increased 7% due to a 5% increase\\nfrom pricing, a 1% increase from volume and a 1% increase due to the favorable\\neffect of foreign currency translation. The sales growth was primarily due to\\nincreased sales of prosthetic implants, ostomy, wound care and arthroscopy\\nproducts, offset in part by volume declines of other product lines divested in\\n1991. In 1991, sales in the segment increased 9% as a result of increases in\\nknee and hip prostheses and ostomy and wound care products.\\n\\nDuring 1993, the Company sold certain assets of Edward Weck Incorporated and\\nannounced the intention to sell its Xomed-Treace subsidiary.\\n\\nAs a result of the $500 million special charge for pending and future breast\\nimplant product liability claims and related expenses, the medical devices\\nsegment recorded an operating loss of $24 million in 1993. Excluding the 1993\\nspecial charge and the 1992 restructuring charge of $155 million, operating\\nprofit margin was 28.1% in 1993 compared to 27.6% in 1992. The increase in 1993\\nreflects declines in selling and administrative expenses. In 1992, operating\\nprofit margin of 27.6%, excluding the restructuring charge, increased from\\n22.7% in 1991, which included costs associated with the divestiture of certain\\n                                   -  21  -\\n<PAGE>\\nproduct lines.\\n\\nIn the NONPRESCRIPTION HEALTH PRODUCTS SEGMENT, sales of $1,964 million\\nremained at prior year levels as a 5% increase due to pricing was offset by a\\n5% decrease due to volume. Domestic sales decreased 3%, primarily in sales of\\nEXCEDRIN* and BUFFERIN* analgesics, which were adversely affected by increased\\ncompetition in the U.S. market. International sales increased 6%, primarily due\\nto BUFFERIN*, the leading internal analgesic in Japan, and ISOCAL*, an adult\\nnutritional product. Worldwide sales of infant formulas increased with the\\nintroduction of LACTOFREE*, a milk-based, lactose-free infant formula\\nintroduced in the U.S. in early 1993, and growth in sales of NUTRAMIGEN* and\\nGerber Soy specialty formulas as well as ENFAPRO* and Gerber Baby routine\\nformulas. These increases were offset in part by reduced sales of ENFAMIL* and\\nPROSOBEE* under the federal government\\'s Women, Infants and Children (WIC)\\nprogram due to the loss of certain sole source contracts in late 1992 and early\\n1993. In the latter part of 1993, five new WIC contracts, in Pennsylvania,\\nMissouri, South Carolina, Colorado and Mississippi, became effective.\\n\\nIn 1992, worldwide sales of nonprescription health products increased 3% due to\\na 5% increase in pricing, offset in part by a 2% decrease due to volume. The\\nsales growth was primarily due to increases in international sales of ENFAMIL*,\\nENFAPRO* and PROSOBEE* infant formulas and BUFFERIN* analgesics. In 1991, sales\\nin the segment increased 7% as a result of Gerber Baby Formula, ENFAPRO*,\\nPROSOBEE*, SUSTAGEN*, EXCEDRIN* IB, EXCEDRIN PM* and BUFFERIN* AF Nite Time.\\n\\nOperating profit margin of 23.6% in 1993 remained relatively unchanged from the\\n23.7% reported in 1992, excluding the 1992 charge of $150 million for\\nrestructuring worldwide operations of the nonprescription health products\\nsegment and a $46 million charge for the cost of settlements relating to the\\nCompany\\'s infant formula business. In 1992, operating profit margin of 23.7%,\\nexcluding the 1992 charges, increased from 22.9% in 1991.\\n\\nSales in the TOILETRIES AND BEAUTY AIDS SEGMENT increased 1% in 1993 to $1,232\\nmillion, reflecting a 2% increase due to pricing, a 1% increase due to volume\\nand a 2% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency\\ntranslation. Domestic sales increased 1%, and international sales increased 2%.\\nSales of the Company\\'s haircoloring products increased, as GLINTS* Conditioning\\nColor Enhancer, a new haircoloring product introduced in the U.S. aimed at new\\nand younger users, performed exceptionally well during its first year, as did\\nLASTING COLOR BY LOVING CARE* and BRIGHTS BY NICE \\'N EASY*. Sales of skin care\\nproducts increased due to international growth of SEA BREEZE* and sales from\\nLaboratori Guieu, an Italian over-the-counter skin care company acquired in\\nearly 1993. In the Company\\'s line of anti-perspirants, sales of BAN* increased,\\nreflecting the introduction of BAN CLEAR* A.P., a clear solid anti-perspirant,\\nlaunched in the U.S. and Canada.\\n\\nIn 1992, sales in the toiletries and beauty aids segment increased 1% due to a\\n3% increase in pricing, offset in part by a 2% decrease in volume. Increased\\nsales of anti-perspirants and haircoloring products were partially offset by\\ndeclines of beauty appliances and other hair care products. In 1991, sales in\\nthe segment decreased 5% as increased sales of haircoloring products and\\nanti-perspirants were more than offset by declines in other brands.\\n\\nIn December 1993, the Company sold the beauty appliance division of Clairol.\\n\\nOperating profit margin in 1993 was 13.2% compared to 13.1% in 1992, after\\nadjusting for the 1992 charge of $150 million for restructuring the worldwide\\ntoiletries and beauty aids segment. In 1992, operating profit margin of 13.1%,\\n                                   -  22  -\\n<PAGE>\\nexcluding the restructuring charge, decreased from 16.9% in 1991 partially due\\nto increased advertising and promotion expenditures as a percentage of sales.\\n\\n\\nGEOGRAPHIC AREAS\\n- ----------------\\nIn 1993, sales of the Company\\'s domestic operations increased 4% primarily as a\\nresult of gains in the pharmaceutical products segment. Operating profit margin\\nfrom domestic operations was 23.2% in 1993 compared to 19.9% in 1992. Excluding\\nthe 1993 special charge of $500 million and the 1992 restructuring charge of\\n$595 million, operating profit margin increased to 29.8% in 1993 from 28.0% in\\n1992. The increase reflects declines in selling and administrative expenses,\\noffset in part by increased manufacturing costs of newer pharmaceutical\\nproducts. In 1992, domestic sales, which were adversely affected by actions\\ntaken by wholesalers to reduce their inventories of pharmaceuticals, increased\\n1%. Operating profit margin, after adjusting for the 1992 restructuring charge,\\nwas 28.0% compared to 28.1% in 1991 in part due to increased selling and\\npromotion expenses.\\n\\nInternationally, sales in 1993 remained at prior year levels. Excluding the\\nunfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, international sales\\nincreased 5% in the year. International sales increased 12% in 1992 and 7% in\\n1991.\\n\\nSales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area sales, decreased 8% in\\n1993 as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation as well as lower\\npharmaceutical sales in certain European countries reflecting restrictive\\ngovernment cost-containment measures. Operating profit margin was 19.3%\\ncompared to 21.1% in 1992, excluding the 1992 restructuring charge of $134\\nmillion, primarily as a result of declines in the pharmaceutical products\\nsegment. In 1992, sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa increased 13%,\\nreflecting growth of PRAVACHOL*, CAPOTEN*, prosthetic implants, ostomy and\\nwound care products, as well as introductory sales of MONOPRIL* in Italy.\\nOperating profit margin, excluding the 1992 restructuring charge, was 21.1%\\ncompared to 22.1% in 1991.\\n\\nSales in Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 5% in 1993, primarily due\\nto increased sales of anti-infectives, cardiovasculars, haircoloring products\\nand anti-perspirants in Latin America. Operating profit margin of 20.0%\\nremained relatively unchanged from the 20.1% reported in 1992, excluding the\\n1992 restructuring charge of $51 million. In 1992, sales in Other Western\\nHemisphere countries increased 8% primarily due to volume growth of\\ncardiovasculars, anti-infectives and infant formulas in Latin America.\\nOperating profit margin was 20.1% in 1992, excluding the restructuring charge,\\ncompared to 19.8% in 1991.\\n\\nSales in the Pacific area increased 15% in 1993 as a result of favorable\\nforeign currency translation and increased sales of prosthetic implants, infant\\nformulas and anti-cancer drugs. Operating profit margin was 15.8% compared to\\n12.6% in 1992, excluding the 1992 restructuring charge of $46 million,\\nprimarily as a result of improvements in the pharmaceutical products and\\nmedical devices segments. In 1992, Pacific area sales increased 12% due to\\ngrowth of infant formulas, prosthetic implants, cardiovascular drugs and\\nanalgesics. Operating profit margin was 12.6%, excluding the 1992 restructuring\\ncharge, compared to 10.3% in 1991, reflecting improvements in the medical\\ndevices segment.\\n                                   -  23  -\\n<PAGE>\\nFINANCIAL POSITION\\n- ------------------\\nThe Company considers cash, including cash equivalents, time deposits and\\nmarketable securities as its principal measure of liquidity. These items\\ntotaled $2.7 billion at December 31, 1993, increasing from $2.4 billion and\\n$1.6 billion at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The Company also\\ncontinues to maintain a high level of working capital, increasing to $3.5\\nbillion at December 31, 1993 from $3.3 billion at December 31, 1992 and $2.8\\nbillion at December 31, 1991. The Company\\'s current ratio at December 31, 1993\\nincreased to 2.14 from 2.01 in 1992 and 2.02 in 1991. Cash and cash\\nequivalents, time deposits and marketable securities and the conversion of\\nother working capital items to cash are expected to be adequate to fund the\\noperations of the Company and any product liability claims and related\\nexpenses.\\n\\nShort-term borrowings decreased to $177 million from $375 million and $553\\nmillion at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively, reflecting repayments of\\ninternational borrowings. In June 1993, the Company issued $350 million\\nprincipal amount of 7.15% Debentures Due 2023, for general corporate purposes,\\nincluding stock purchase programs, working capital, capital expenditures,\\nrepayment or refinancing of borrowings and acquisitions.\\n\\nInternally generated cash from operations continued to increase in 1993 to $2.6\\nbillion from $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion in 1992 and 1991, respectively,\\nreflecting the Company\\'s ongoing commitment to improve cash flow and working\\ncapital needs. Cash provided by operations continued to be the primary source\\nfor financing expenditures for new plant and equipment.

The consolidated financial statements include the\\naccounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its subsidiaries.\\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily include\\nsecurities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase,\\nrecorded at cost, which approximates market.\\n\\nTime Deposits and Marketable Securities - Time deposits and marketable\\nsecurities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which\\napproximates cost.\\n\\nInventory Valuation - Inventories are generally stated at average cost, not in\\nexcess of market.\\n\\nProperty and Depreciation - Expenditures for additions, renewals and\\nbetterments are capitalized at cost.  Depreciation is generally computed by the\\nstraight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\\n\\nExcess of Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess of cost over net tangible\\nassets received in business acquisitions subsequent to October 31, 1970 is\\nbeing amortized on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding forty\\nyears.\\n\\nEarnings Per Share - Earnings per common share are computed using the weighted\\naverage number of shares outstanding during the year.  The effect of shares\\nissuable under stock plans is not significant.\\n\\n\\nNote 2  SPECIAL CHARGE\\n- ----------------------\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a special charge of $500\\nmillion before taxes, $310 million after taxes, or $.60 per share, in\\nconnection with pending and future breast implant product liability claims\\nagainst the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation, and\\ncertain other subsidiaries.  The special charge consists of $1.5 billion for\\npotential liabilities and expenses related to breast implant claims ($1.4\\nbillion recorded as a long-term liability in Product Liability and $.1 billion\\nrecorded as a current liability in Accrued Expenses), offset by $1 billion of\\nexpected insurance proceeds (recorded as Insurance Recoverable).  Although the\\nCompany is currently engaged in coverage litigation with certain of its\\ninsurers, such expected insurance proceeds represent the amount of insurance\\nwhich the Company considers appropriate to record as recoverable at this time.\\nThe Company believes that ultimately it will obtain substantial additional\\namounts of insurance proceeds.

This charge primarily covered the costs of reducing\\nemployment levels, including a voluntary retirement program for the Company\\'s\\nU.S. employees, and streamlining worldwide production and distribution\\noperations.

The medical plan is contributory.\\nContributions are adjusted periodically and vary by date of retirement and the\\noriginal retiring company.  The life insurance plan is non-contributory.\\n\\nEffective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of\\nFinancial Accounting Standards No. 106,  Employers\\' Accounting for\\nPostretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (FAS 106).  This statement requires\\nthat the costs of postretirement benefits, primarily health care benefits, be\\naccrued during an employee\\'s active working career.  In prior years, these\\ncosts were expensed as paid.  The Company recorded the discounted value of\\nexpected future benefits attributed to employees\\' service rendered prior to\\n1992 as a cumulative effect of an accounting change.  This one-time non-cash\\naccounting change was $390 million before taxes, $246 million after taxes, or\\n$.47 per share.\\n                                   -  38  -\\n<PAGE>\\n                         BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY\\n                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n                           (in millions of dollars)\\n\\nCost for the Company\\'s postretirement benefit plans included the following\\ncomponents:\\n                                                           Year Ended\\n                                                           December 31,\\n                                                       -------------------\\n                                                       1993           1992\\n                                                       ----           ----\\n\\nService cost - benefits earned during the year          $ 8            $ 8\\nInterest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit\\n  obligation                                             32             30\\nActual earnings on plan assets                          (2)              -\\n                                                       ----           ----\\nPostretirement benefit expense                          $38            $38\\n                                                       ====           ====\\n\\nThe status of the plans was as follows:\\n                                                          December 31,\\n                                                      --------------------\\n                                                       1993           1992\\n                                                      -----          -----\\nAccumulated postretirement benefit obligation:\\n  Retirees                                           $(380)         $(251)\\n  Fully eligible active plan participants              (17)           (27)\\n  Other active plan participants                      (124)          (131)\\n                                                      -----          -----\\n                                                      (521)          (409)\\nPlan assets at fair value                                28              7\\n                                                      -----          -----\\nAccumulated postretirement benefit obligation\\n  in excess of plan assets                            (493)          (402)\\nUnrecognized prior service cost                         (1)              -\\nUnrecognized net losses                                  42              -\\n                                                      -----          -----\\nAccrued postretirement benefit expense               $(452)         $(402)\\n                                                      =====          =====\\n\\nIn 1993, the increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was\\nprimarily due to a lower discount rate and the effect of the voluntary\\nretirement program offered to the Company\\'s U.S. employees.\\n\\nFor measurement purposes, an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of\\ncovered health care benefits of 12.3% for participants under age 65 and 10.2%\\nfor participants age 65 and over was assumed for 1994; the rate was assumed to\\ndecrease gradually to 5.2% in 2007 and to remain at that level thereafter.\\nIncreasing the assumed medical care cost trend rates by 1 percentage point in\\neach year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as\\nof December 31, 1993 by $28 million and the aggregate of the service and\\ninterest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense for the year\\nthen ended by $2 million.

Purpose:The purpose of the 1983 Stock Option Plan (as amended and restated\\n    as of January 1, 1993) (the \"Plan\") is to secure for the Company and its\\n    stockholders the benefits of the incentive inherent in common stock\\n    ownership by the officers and key employees of the Company and its\\n    Subsidiaries and Affiliates who will be largely responsible for the\\n    Company\\'s future growth and continued financial success and by providing\\n    long-term incentives in addition to current compensation to certain key\\n    executives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates who\\n    contribute significantly to the long-term performance and growth of the\\n    Company and such Subsidiaries and Affiliates.  It is intended that the\\n    former purpose will be effected through the grant of stock options and\\n    stock appreciation rights under the Plan and that the latter purpose will\\n    be effected through an award conditionally granting performance units under\\n    the Plan, either independently or in conjunction with and related to a\\n    nonqualified stock option grant under the Plan.

In addition, the Committee may grant\\n                     stock appreciation rights in conjunction with an option,\\n                     as set forth in Section 6(b)(11), or may grant awards in\\n                     conjunction with an option, as set forth in Section\\n                     6(b)(10) (an \"Associated Option\").\\n\\n    Each option shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:\\n\\n    (a) Grant of Options.  The Committee shall (1) select the officers and key\\n        employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom\\n        options may from time to time be granted, (2) determine whether\\n\\n                                    E-2-3\\n<PAGE>\\n        incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, are to be\\n        granted, (3) determine the number of shares to be covered by each\\n        option so granted, (4) determine the terms and conditions (not\\n        inconsistent with the Plan) of any option granted hereunder (including\\n        but not limited to restrictions upon the options, conditions of their\\n        exercise, or on the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise\\n        thereof), (5) determine whether nonqualified stock options or incentive\\n        stock options granted under the Plan shall include stock appreciation\\n        rights and, if so, shall determine the terms and conditions thereof in\\n        accordance with Section 6(b)(11) hereof, (6) determine whether any\\n        nonqualified stock options granted under the Plan shall be Associated\\n        Options, and (7) prescribe the form of the instruments necessary or\\n        advisable in the administration of options.\\n\\n    (b) Terms and Conditions of Option.  Any option granted under the Plan\\n        shall be evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement executed by the Company\\n        and the optionee, in such form as the Committee shall approve, which\\n        agreement shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and\\n        shall contain such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent\\n        with the Plan, and in the case of an incentive stock option not\\n        inconsistent with the provisions of the Code applicable to incentive\\n        stock options, as the Committee shall prescribe:\\n\\n    (1) Number of Shares Subject to an Option.  The Stock Option Agreement\\n        shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the\\n        Agreement.  If the option is an Associated Option, the number of shares\\n        of Common Stock subject to such Associated Option shall initially be\\n        equal to the number of performance units subject to the award, but one\\n        share of Common Stock shall be canceled for each performance unit paid\\n        out under the award.\\n\\n    (2) Option Price.  The purchase price per share of Common Stock purchasable\\n        under an option will be determined by the Committee but will be not\\n        less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date\\n        of the grant of such option.\\n\\n    (3) Option Period.  The period of each option shall be fixed by the\\n        Committee, but no option shall be exercisable after the expiration of\\n        ten years from the date the option is granted.\\n\\n    (4) Consideration.  Each optionee, as consideration for the grant of an\\n        option, shall remain in the continuous employ of the Company or of one\\n        of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for at least one year from the date\\n        of the granting of such option, and no option shall be exercisable\\n        until after the completion of such one year period of employment by the\\n        optionee.\\n\\n    (5) Exercise of Option.  An option may be exercised in whole or in part\\n        from time to time during the option period (or, if determined by the\\n        Committee, in specified installments during the option period) by\\n        giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number\\n        of shares to be purchased, such notice to be accompanied by payment in\\n        full of the purchase price and Withholding Taxes (as defined in Section\\n        10 hereof) due either by certified or bank check, or in shares of\\n        Common Stock of the Company owned by the optionee having a Fair Market\\n        Value at the date of exercise equal to such purchase price and\\n        Withholding Taxes due, or in a combination of the foregoing; provided,\\n        however, that payment in shares of Common Stock of the Company will not\\n\\n                                    E-2-4\\n<PAGE>\\n        be permitted unless at least 100 shares of Common Stock are required\\n        and delivered for such purpose.  No shares shall be issued until full\\n        payment therefor has been made.  An optionee shall have the rights of a\\n        stockholder only with respect to shares of stock for which certificates\\n        have been issued to the optionee.\\n\\n    (6) Nontransferability of Options.  No option or stock appreciation right\\n        granted under the Plan shall be transferable by the optionee otherwise\\n        than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and such\\n        option or stock appreciation right shall be exercisable, during the\\n        optionee\\'s lifetime, only by the optionee.\\n\\n    (7) Retirement and Termination of Employment Other than by Death or\\n        Disability.  If an optionee shall cease to be employed by the Company\\n        or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any reason (other than\\n        termination of employment by reason of death or Disability) after the\\n        optionee shall have been continuously so employed for one year after\\n        the granting of the option, the option shall be exercisable only to the\\n        extent that the optionee was otherwise entitled to exercise it at the\\n        time of such cessation of employment with the Company, Subsidiary or\\n        Affiliate, but in no event after the expiration of the option period\\n        set forth therein except that in the case of cessation of employment\\n        other than by reason of Retirement or death, the option shall in no\\n        event be exercisable after the date three months next succeeding such\\n        cessation of employment.  The Plan does not confer upon any optionee\\n        any right with respect to continuation of employment by the Company or\\n        any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.\\n\\n    (8) Disability of Optionee.  An optionee who ceases to be employed by\\n        reason of Disability shall be treated as though the optionee remained\\n        in the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate until the\\n        earlier of (i) cessation of payments under a disability pay plan of the\\n        Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate, (ii) the optionee\\'s death, or (iii)\\n        the optionee\\'s 65th birthday.\\n\\n    (9) Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of the optionee while in\\n        the employ of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates\\n        or within whichever period after Retirement or cessation of employment\\n        of the optionee specified in subsection (7) or (8) is applicable, and\\n        provided the optionee shall have been continuously so employed for one\\n        year after the granting of the option, the option shall be exercisable\\n        by the executors, administrators, legatees or distributees of the\\n        optionee\\'s estate, as the case may be, at any time following death but\\n        in no event after the expiration of the option period set forth therein\\n        and only to the extent that the optionee would otherwise have been\\n        entitled to exercise it if the optionee were then living, except that\\n        in the case of the death of an optionee after Retirement or other\\n        cessation of employment, the option shall in no event be exercisable\\n        after the later of (i) the date twelve months next succeeding such\\n        death or (ii) the last day of the period after Retirement or other\\n        cessation of employment of the optionee specified in Section 6(b)(7).\\n        In the event any option is exercised by the executors, administrators,\\n        legatees or distributees of the estate of a deceased optionee, the\\n        Company shall be under no obligation to issue stock thereunder unless\\n        and until the Company is satisfied that the person or persons\\n        exercising the option are the duly appointed legal representatives of\\n        the deceased optionee\\'s estate or the proper legatees or distributees\\n        thereof.\\n\\n                                    E-2-5\\n<PAGE>\\n   (10) Long Term Performance Awards.  The Committee may from time to time\\n        grant nonqualified stock options under the Plan in conjunction with and\\n        related to an award of performance units made under a Long Term\\n        Performance Award as set forth in Section 7(b)(11).  In such event,\\n        notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (i) the number of shares to\\n        which the Associated Option applies shall initially be equal to the\\n        number of performance units granted by the award, but such number of\\n        shares shall be reduced on a one share-for-one unit basis to the extent\\n        that the Committee determines pursuant to the terms of the award, to\\n        pay to the optionee or the optionee\\'s beneficiary the performance units\\n        granted pursuant to such award; and (ii) such Associated Option shall\\n        be cancelable in the discretion of the Committee, without the consent\\n        of the optionee, under the conditions and to the extent specified in\\n        the award.\\n\\n   (11) Stock Appreciation Rights.  In the case of any option granted under the\\n        Plan, either at the time of grant or by amendment of such option at any\\n        time after such grant there may be included a stock appreciation right\\n        which shall be subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent\\n        with the Plan, as the Committee shall impose, including the following:\\n\\n    (A) A stock appreciation right shall be exercisable to the extent, and only\\n        to the extent, that the option in which it is included is at the time\\n        exercisable, and may be exercised within such period only at such time\\n        or times as may be determined by the Committee;\\n\\n    (B) A stock appreciation right shall entitle the optionee (or any person\\n        entitled to act under the provisions of subsection (9) hereof) to\\n        surrender unexercised the option in which the stock appreciation right\\n        is included (or any portion of such option) to the Company and to\\n        receive from the Company in exchange therefor that number of shares\\n        having an aggregate value equal to (or, in the discretion of the\\n        Committee, less than) the excess of the value of one share (provided\\n        such value does not exceed such multiple of the option price per share\\n        as may be specified by the Committee) over the option price per share\\n        specified in such option times the number of shares called for by the\\n        option, or portion thereof, which is so surrendered.  The Committee\\n        shall be entitled to cause the Company to settle its obligation,\\n        arising out of the exercise of a stock appreciation right, by the\\n        payment of cash equal to the aggregate value of the shares the Company\\n        would otherwise be obligated to deliver or partly by the payment of\\n        cash and partly by the delivery of shares.  Any such election shall be\\n        made within 30 business days after the receipt by the Committee of\\n        written notice of the exercise of the stock appreciation right.  The\\n        value of a share for this purpose shall be the Fair Market Value\\n        thereof on the last business day preceding the date of the election to\\n        exercise the stock appreciation right;\\n\\n    (C) No fractional shares shall be delivered under this subsection (11) but\\n        in lieu thereof a cash adjustment shall be made;\\n\\n    (D) If a stock appreciation right included in an option is exercised, such\\n        option shall be deemed to have been exercised to the extent of the\\n        number of shares called for by the option or portion thereof which is\\n        surrendered on exercise of the stock appreciation right and no new\\n        option may be granted covering such shares under this Plan; and\\n\\n    (E) If an option which includes a stock appreciation right is exercised,\\n\\n                                    E-2-6\\n<PAGE>\\n        such stock appreciation right shall be deemed to have been canceled to\\n        the extent of the number of shares called for by the option or portion\\n        thereof is exercised and no new stock appreciation rights may be\\n        granted covering such shares under this Plan.\\n\\n   (12) Incentive Stock Options.  In the case of any incentive stock option\\n        granted under the Plan, the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares\\n        of Common Stock of the Company (determined at the time of grant of each\\n        option) with respect to which incentive stock options granted under the\\n        Plan and any other plan of the Company or its parent or a Subsidiary\\n        which are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any\\n        calendar year shall not exceed $100,000 or such other amount as may be\\n        required by the Code.  In any year, the maximum number of shares with\\n        respect to which incentive stock options may be granted shall not\\n        exceed 4,000,000 shares.\\n\\n    7.  Long-term Performance Awards:  Awards under the Plan shall consist of\\n        the conditional grant to the participants of a specified number of\\n        performance units.  The conditional grant of a performance unit to a\\n        participant will entitle the participant to receive a specified dollar\\n        value, variable under conditions specified in the award, if the\\n        performance objectives specified in the award are achieved and the\\n        other terms and conditions thereof are satisfied.\\n\\n    Each award will be subject to the following terms and conditions:\\n\\n    (a) Grant of Awards.  The Committee shall (1) select the officers and key\\n        executives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom\\n        awards may from time to time be granted, (2) determine the number of\\n        performance units covered by each award, (3) determine the terms and\\n        conditions of each performance unit awarded and the award period and\\n        performance objectives with respect to each award, (4) determine the\\n        periods during which a participant may request the Committee to approve\\n        deferred payment of a percentage (50% or 100%) of an award (the\\n        \"Deferred Portion\") and the interest or rate of return thereon or the\\n        basis on which such interest or rate of return thereon is to be\\n        determined, (5) determine whether payment with respect to the portion\\n        of an award which has not been deferred (the \"Current Portion\") and the\\n        payment with respect to the Deferred Portion of an award shall be made\\n        entirely in cash, entirely in Common Stock or partially in cash and\\n        partially in Common Stock, (6) determine whether the award is to be\\n        made independently of or in conjunction with a nonqualified stock\\n        option granted under the Plan, and (7) prescribe the form of the\\n        instruments necessary or advisable in the administration of the awards.\\n\\n    (b) Terms and Conditions of Award.  Any award conditionally granting\\n        performance units to a participant shall be evidenced by a Performance\\n        Unit Agreement executed by the Company and the participant, in such\\n        form as the Committee shall approve, which Agreement shall contain in\\n        substance the following terms and conditions and such additional terms\\n        and conditions as the Committee shall prescribe:\\n\\n    (1) Number of Performance Units.  The Performance Unit Agreement shall\\n        specify the number of performance units conditionally granted to the\\n        participant.  If the award has been made in conjunction with the grant\\n        of an Associated Option, the number of performance units granted shall\\n        initially be equal to the number of shares which the participant is\\n        granted the right to purchase pursuant to the Associated Option, but\\n\\n                                    E-2-7\\n<PAGE>\\n        one performance unit shall be canceled for each share of the Company\\'s\\n        Common Stock purchased upon exercise of the Associated Option or for\\n        each stock appreciation right included in such option that has been\\n        exercised.\\n\\n    (2) Value of Performance Units.  The Performance Unit Agreement shall\\n        specify the threshold, target and maximum dollar values of each\\n        performance unit and corresponding performance objectives as provided\\n        under Section 7(b)(5).\\n\\n    (3) Award Periods.  For each award, the Committee shall designate an award\\n        period with a duration to be determined by the Committee in its\\n        discretion but in no event less than three calendar years within which\\n        specified performance objectives are to be attained.  There may be\\n        several award periods in existence at any one time and the duration of\\n        performance objectives may differ from each other.\\n\\n    (4) Consideration.  Each participant, as consideration for the award of\\n        performance units, shall remain in the continuous employ of the Company\\n        or of one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for at least one year after\\n        the date of the making of such award, and no award shall be payable\\n        until after the completion of such one year of employment by the\\n        participant.\\n\\n    (5) Performance Objectives.  The Committee shall establish performance\\n        objectives with respect to the Company for each award period on the\\n        basis of such criteria and to accomplish such objectives as the\\n        Committee may from time to time determine.  Performance objectives may\\n        include objective and subjective criteria.  During any award period,\\n        the Committee may adjust the performance objectives for such award\\n        period as it deems equitable in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring\\n        events affecting the Company, changes in applicable tax laws or\\n        accounting principles, or such other factors as the Committee may\\n        determine.\\n\\n    (6) Determination and Payment of Performance Units Earned.  As soon as\\n        practicable after the end of an award period, the Committee shall\\n        determine the extent to which awards have been earned on the basis of\\n        the Company\\'s actual performance in relation to the established\\n        performance objectives as set forth in the Performance Unit Agreement.\\n        The Performance Unit Agreement shall specify that as soon as\\n        practicable after the end of each award period, the Committee shall\\n        determine whether the conditions of Sections 7(b)(4) and 7(b)(5) hereof\\n        have been met and, if so, shall ascertain the amount payable to the\\n        participant in respect of the performance units.  As promptly as\\n        practicable after it has determined that an amount is payable in\\n        respect of an award, the Committee shall cause the Current Portion of\\n        such award to be paid to the participant or the participant\\'s\\n        beneficiaries, as the case may be, in the Committee\\'s discretion,\\n        either entirely in cash, entirely in Common Stock or partially in cash\\n        and partially in Common Stock.  The Deferred Portion of an award shall\\n        be contingently credited and payable to the participant over a deferred\\n        period and shall be credited with interest or a rate of return, as\\n        determined by the Committee.  The Committee, in its discretion, shall\\n        determine the conditions upon, and method of, payment of such deferred\\n        portions and whether such payment will be made entirely in cash,\\n        entirely in Common Stock or partially in cash and partially in Common\\n        Stock.\\n\\n                                    E-2-8\\n<PAGE>\\n        In making the payment of an award in Common Stock hereunder, the cash\\n        equivalent of such Common Stock shall be determined by the Fair Market\\n        Value of the Common Stock on the day the Committee designates the\\n        performance units shall be paid.\\n\\n    (7) Nontransferability of Awards and Designation of Beneficiaries.  No\\n        award under the Plan shall be transferable by the participant other\\n        than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, except that a\\n        participant may designate a beneficiary pursuant to the provisions\\n        hereof.\\n\\n        If any participant or the participant\\'s beneficiary shall attempt to\\n        assign the participant\\'s rights under the Plan in violation of the\\n        provisions thereof, the Company\\'s obligation to make any further\\n        payments to such participant or the participant\\'s beneficiaries shall\\n        forthwith terminate.\\n\\n        A participant may name one or more beneficiaries to receive any payment\\n        of an award to which the participant may be entitled under the Plan in\\n        the event of the participant\\'s death, on a form to be provided by the\\n        Committee.  A participant may change the participant\\'s beneficiary\\n        designation from time to time in the same manner.\\n\\n        If no designated beneficiary is living on the date on which any payment\\n        becomes payable to a participant\\'s beneficiary, such payment will be\\n        payable to the person or persons in the first of the following classes\\n        of successive preference:\\n\\n    (i) Widow or widower, if then living,\\n   (ii) Surviving children, equally,\\n  (iii) Surviving parents, equally,\\n   (iv) Surviving brothers and sisters, equally,\\n    (v) Executors or administrators\\n\\n        and the term \"beneficiary\" as used in the Plan shall include such\\n        person or persons.\\n\\n    (8) Retirement and Termination of Employment Other Than by Death or\\n        Disability.  In the event of the Retirement prior to the end of an\\n        award period of a participant who has satisfied the one year employment\\n        requirement of Section 7(b)(4) with respect to an award prior to\\n        Retirement, the participant, or his estate, shall be entitled to a\\n        payment of such award at the end of the award period, pursuant to the\\n        terms of the Plan and the participant\\'s Performance Unit Agreement,\\n        provided, however, that the participant shall be deemed to have earned\\n        that proportion (to the nearest whole unit) of the value of the\\n        performance units granted to the participant under such award as the\\n        number of months of the award period which have elapsed since the first\\n        day of the calendar year in which the award was made to the end of the\\n        month in which the participant\\'s Retirement occurs, bears to the total\\n        number of months in the award period.  The participant\\'s rights in any\\n        remaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.\\n\\n        Subject to Section 7(b)(6) hereof, the Performance Unit Agreement shall\\n        specify that the rights of the participant in the performance units\\n        granted to such participant shall be conditional and shall be canceled,\\n        forfeited and surrendered if the participant\\'s continuous employment\\n        with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall terminate\\n\\n                                    E-2-9\\n<PAGE>\\n        for any reason, other than the participant\\'s death, Disability or\\n        Retirement prior to the end of the award period.\\n\\n        The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part, the\\n        cancellation, forfeiture and surrender of any performance units.\\n\\n    (9) Disability of Participant.  For the purposes of any award a participant\\n        who becomes Disabled shall be deemed to have suspended active\\n        employment by reason of Disability commencing on the date the\\n        participant becomes entitled to receive payments under a disability pay\\n        plan of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate and continuing until\\n        the date the participant is no longer entitled to receive such\\n        payments.  In the event a participant becomes Disabled during an award\\n        period but only if the participant has satisfied the one year\\n        employment requirement of Section 7(b)(4) with respect to an award\\n        prior to becoming Disabled, upon the determination by the Committee of\\n        the extent to which an award has been earned pursuant to Section\\n        7(b)(6) the participant shall be deemed to have earned that proportion\\n        (to the nearest whole unit) of the value of the performance units\\n        granted to the participants under such award as the number of months of\\n        the award period in which the participant was not Disabled bears to the\\n        total number of months of the award period.  The participant\\'s rights\\n        in any remaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.\\n\\n        The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part, such\\n        cancellation and forfeiture of any performance units.\\n\\n   (10) Death of Participant.  In the event of the death prior to the end of an\\n        award period of a participant who has satisfied the one year employment\\n        requirement with respect to an award prior to the date of death, the\\n        participant\\'s beneficiaries or estate, as the case may be, shall be\\n        entitled to a payment of such award upon the end of the award period,\\n        pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the participant\\'s Performance\\n        Unit Agreement, provided, however, that the participant shall be deemed\\n        to have earned that proportion (to the nearest whole unit) of the value\\n        of the performance units granted to the participant under such award as\\n        the number of months of the award period which have elapsed since the\\n        first day of the calendar year in which the award was made to the end\\n        of the month in which the participant\\'s death occurs, bears to the\\n        total number of months in the award period.  The participant\\'s rights\\n        in any remaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.\\n\\n        The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part, such\\n        cancellation and forfeiture of any performance units.\\n\\n   (11) Grant of Associated Option.  If the Committee determines that the\\n        conditional grant of performance units under the Plan is to be made to\\n        a participant in conjunction with the grant of a nonqualified stock\\n        option under the Plan, the Committee shall grant the participant an\\n        Associated Option under the Plan subject to the terms and conditions of\\n        this subsection (11).  In such event, such award under the Plan shall\\n        be contingent upon the participant\\'s being granted such an Associated\\n        Option pursuant to which:  (i) the number of shares the optionee may\\n        purchase shall initially be equal to the number of performance units\\n        conditionally granted by the award, (ii) such number of shares shall be\\n        reduced on a one share-for-one unit basis to the extent that the\\n        Committee determines, pursuant to Section 7(b)(6) hereof, to pay to the\\n        participant or the participant\\'s beneficiaries the performance units\\n\\n                                    E-2-10\\n<PAGE>\\n        conditionally granted pursuant to the award, and (iii) the Associated\\n        Option shall be cancelable in the discretion of the Committee, without\\n        the consent of the participant, under the conditions and to the extent\\n        specified herein and in Section 7(b)(6) hereof.\\n\\n        If no amount is payable in respect of the conditionally granted\\n        performance units, the award and such performance units shall be deemed\\n        to have been canceled, forfeited and surrendered, and the Associated\\n        Option, if any, shall continue in effect in accordance with its terms.\\n        If any amount is payable in respect of the performance units and such\\n        units were granted in conjunction with an Associated Option, the\\n        Committee shall, within 30 days after the determination of the\\n        Committee referred to in the first sentence of Section 7(b)(6),\\n        determine, in its sole discretion, either:\\n\\n    (A) to cancel in full the Associated Option, in which event the value of\\n        the performance units payable pursuant to Sections 7(b)(5) and (6)\\n        shall be paid;\\n\\n    (B) to cancel in full the performance units, in which event no amount shall\\n        be paid to the participant in respect thereof but the Associated Option\\n        shall continue in effect in accordance with its terms; or\\n\\n    (C) to cancel some, but not all, of the performance units, in which event\\n        the value of the performance units payable pursuant to Sections 7(b)(5)\\n        and (6) which have not been canceled shall be paid and the Associated\\n        Option shall be canceled with respect to that number of shares equal to\\n        the number of conditionally granted performance units that remain\\n        payable.\\n\\n        Any action taken by the Committee pursuant to the preceding sentence\\n        shall be uniform with respect to all awards having the same award\\n        period.  If the Committee takes no such action, it shall be deemed to\\n        have determined to cancel in full the award in accordance with clause\\n        (B) above.\\n\\n    8.  Determination of Breach of Conditions:  The determination of the\\n        Committee as to whether an event has occurred resulting in a forfeiture\\n        or a termination or reduction of the Company\\'s obligations in\\n        accordance with the provisions of the Plan shall be conclusive.\\n\\n    9.  Adjustment in the Event of Change in Stock:  In the event of changes in\\n        the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of stock\\n        dividends, recapitalization, mergers, consolidations, split-ups,\\n        combinations or exchanges of shares and the like, the aggregate number\\n        and class of shares available under the Plan, and the number, class and\\n        the price of shares subject to outstanding options and/or awards and\\n        the number of performance units and/or the dollar value of each unit\\n        shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee, whose determination\\n        shall be conclusive.\\n\\n    10. Taxes:  In connection with the transfer of shares of Common Stock to an\\n        optionee, subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, as the result of\\n        the exercise of a nonqualified stock option or a stock appreciation\\n        right, or to a participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act,\\n        upon payment of an award, the Company shall have the right to retain or\\n        sell without notice, or to demand surrender of, shares of Common Stock\\n        having a Fair Market Value (taking into account any commissions or\\n\\n                                    E-2-11\\n<PAGE>\\n        other expenses the Company may incur upon the sale of such shares) on\\n        the date that the amount required by any governmental entity to be\\n        withheld or otherwise deducted and paid with respect to such transfer\\n        (\"Withholding Tax\") is to be determined (the \"Tax Date\") sufficient to\\n        cover the amount of any Applicable Tax (the amount of Withholding Tax\\n        plus the incremental amount determined on the basis of the highest\\n        marginal tax rate applicable to such optionee or participant, Federal\\n        Insurance Contribution Act taxes or other governmental impost or levy),\\n        and to make payment (or to reimburse itself for payment made) to the\\n        appropriate taxing authority of an amount in cash equal to the amount\\n        of such Applicable Tax, remitting any balance to the optionee or\\n        participant.\\n\\n        An optionee or participant who is not an executive officer of the\\n        Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be entitled to\\n        satisfy the obligation to pay any Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax, by\\n        providing the Company with funds sufficient to enable the Company to\\n        pay such Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax or by requiring the Company\\n        to retain or to accept upon delivery thereof by the optionee or\\n        participant shares of Common Stock sufficient in value (determined in\\n        accordance with the last sentence of the preceding paragraph), to cover\\n        the amount of such Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax.  Each election by\\n        an optionee or participant to have shares retained or to deliver shares\\n        for this purpose shall be subject to the following restrictions:  (i)\\n        the election must be in writing and be made on or prior to the Tax\\n        Date; (ii) the election must be irrevocable; (iii) the election shall\\n        be subject to the disapproval of the Committee.\\n\\n    11. Amendment of the Plan:  The Board of Directors may amend or suspend the\\n        Plan at any time and from time to time.  No such amendment of the Plan\\n        may, however, increase the maximum number of shares to be offered under\\n        options or awards, or change the manner of determining the option\\n        price, or change the designation of employees or class of employees\\n        eligible to receive options or awards, or permit the transfer or issue\\n        of stock before payment therefor in full, or, without the written\\n        consent of the optionee or participant, alter or impair any option or\\n        award previously granted under the Plan, Prior Plan or LTPAP.\\n\\n    12.

Furthermore, an\\n        employee who makes an election to retire under Article 19 of the\\n        Retirement Income Plan shall have any additional years of age and\\n        service which are credited under Article 19 of the Retirement Income\\n        Plan taken into account when determining such employee\\'s age and years\\n        of service with the Company or its Subsidiaries under this Section 12.\\n        Such election shall be deemed a Retirement for purposes of this Section\\n        12 and all other purposes of this Plan.\\n\\n\\n                                    E-2-12\\n<PAGE>\\n    13.

Nothing contained in the\\n        Plan or in any Agreement shall require the Company to segregate or\\n        earmark any cash or other property.

Such designation\\n     must be on file with the Committee in order to be effective but, unless\\n     the Participant has made an irrevocable designation, may be changed from\\n     time to time by the Participant.\\n\\n     \"Participant\" means an employee who has received an award of performance\\n     units under the Plan.\\n\\n     \"Payment Schedule\" means the schedule adopted by the Committee in\\n     accordance with Paragraph 6 with respect to each Award Cycle to govern\\n     determination of the Payment Value of a performance unit at the end of\\n     each Award Cycle in accordance with Paragraph 6.\\n\\n     \"Payment Value\" means the value, expressed in dollars, of a performance\\n     unit at the conclusion of an Award Cycle, determined in accordance with\\n     Paragraph 6.\\n\\n     \"Restricted Stock\" means the shares of Common Stock referred to in\\n     Paragraph 8.\\n\\n     \"Unit Base Value\" means the average (rounded to the next highest cent in\\n     the case of fractions of a cent) of the high and low sales prices of the\\n     Common Stock of the Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange on the day\\n     on which performance units are awarded or, if there are no such sales of\\n     Common Stock on that day, the highest asked price therefor on the New York\\n     Stock Exchange on that day.\\n\\n2.

Administration.\\n\\n     The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Subject to the express\\n     provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have plenary authority, in its\\n     discretion, to determine the individuals to whom, and the time or times,\\n     at which performance units or Restricted Stock shall be awarded and\\n     options shall be granted (including without limitation whether such\\n     options shall be Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options or\\n     a combination thereof as such terms are hereinafter defined) and the\\n     number of units and/or shares to be covered by each such award or grant,\\n     provided, however, that in no event shall a Restricted Stock award be made\\n     to an employee who, at the time of such award is an officer or director of\\n     the Corporation. In making such determinations, the Committee may take\\n     into account the nature of the services rendered by the respective\\n     employees, their present and potential contributions to the Corporation\\'s\\n     success and such other factors as the Committee in its discretion may deem\\n     relevant. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee\\n     shall also have plenary authority to interpret the Plan, to prescribe,\\n     amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to it, to determine the\\n     terms and provisions of the respective Restricted Stock, performance unit\\n     and option agreements (which need not be identical) and to make all other\\n     determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.\\n     The Committee\\'s determinations of the matters referred to in this\\n     Paragraph 3 shall be conclusive; provided, however, that the Committee of\\n     the Board administering the Plan shall not have the authority to interpret\\n     the Plan or to prescribe, amend, or rescind rules and regulations to it\\n     that are inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan prohibiting (i) the\\n     acceleration of payments under the Plan, or (ii) the modification of the\\n     interest rate to be credited under the Plan.\\n\\n4.   The Committee.\\n\\n     The Committee shall consist of three or more members of the Board of\\n     Directors of the Corporation who are not eligible to receive options,\\n     Restricted Stock or performance units under the Plan.  The Committee shall\\n     be appointed by the Board of Directors, which may from time to time\\n     appoint members of the Committee in substitution for members previously\\n     appointed and may fill vacancies, however caused, in the Committee.  The\\n     Committee shall select one of its members as its Chairman and shall hold\\n     its meetings at such times and places as it may determine.  A majority of\\n     its members shall constitute a quorum.  All determinations of the\\n     Committee shall be made by not less than a majority of its members. Any\\n\\n                                    E-3-2\\n<PAGE>\\n     decision or determination reduced to writing and signed by all the members\\n     shall be fully as effective as if it had been made by a majority vote at a\\n     meeting duly called and held. The Committee may appoint a secretary, shall\\n     keep minutes of its meetings and shall make such rules and regulations for\\n     the conduct of its business as it shall deem advisable.\\n\\n5.   Eligibility.\\n\\n     Performance units and Restricted Stock may be awarded and options granted\\n     only to key employees (which term as used herein includes officers) of the\\n     Corporation and of its present and future subsidiary corporations (herein\\n     called subsidiaries).  A director of the Corporation or of a subsidiary\\n     who is not also an employee of the Corporation or of a subsidiary will not\\n     be eligible to receive a performance unit or Restricted Stock award or an\\n     option.  Any such employee may receive one or more performance unit awards\\n     or one or more options or one or more Restricted Stock awards, or a\\n     combination thereof, as the Committee shall from time to time determine,\\n     and such determinations may be different as to different employees and may\\n     vary as to different awards and grants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a\\n     Restricted Stock award may in no event be made to an employee who, at the\\n     time the award is made, is an officer or director of the Corporation.\\n\\n6.   Performance Unit Awards.\\n\\n     (a)  Performance units which are awarded to a Participant shall have a\\n          Payment Value at the end of the applicable Award Cycle contingent\\n          upon performance of the Corporation and/or of such Participant\\'s\\n          subsidiary, division or department over the Award Cycle.  The\\n          performance measures may include, but shall not be limited to,\\n          cumulative growth in pre-tax profits, earnings per share, return on\\n          shareholders\\' equity or return on capital employed.  Such measures\\n          may be applied on an absolute basis or relative to industry indices\\n          and shall be defined in a manner which the Committee shall deem\\n          appropriate.  For each Award Cycle, the Committee shall establish a\\n          Payment Schedule based upon the performance measures determined for\\n          such Award Cycle and the length of such Award Cycle.  If during the\\n          course of an Award Cycle there should occur, in the opinion of the\\n          Committee, significant changes in economic conditions or in the\\n          nature of the operations of the Corporation or subsidiary, division\\n          or department which the Committee did not foresee in establishing the\\n          performance measures for such Cycle and which, in the Committee\\'s\\n          sole judgment have, or are expected to have, a substantial effect on\\n          the performance of the Corporation or a Participant\\'s subsidiary,\\n          division or department during such Cycle, the Committee may revise\\n          the Payment Schedule and performance measures formerly determined by\\n          it in such manner, as the Committee, in its sole judgment, may deem\\n          appropriate.\\n\\n     (b)  In determining the number of performance units to be awarded, the\\n          Committee shall take into account an employee\\'s responsibility level,\\n          performance, potential, cash compensation level and such other\\n          considerations as it deems appropriate.\\n\\n     (c)  An award of performance units to a Participant shall terminate for\\n          all purposes if the Participant does not remain, during the Award\\n          Cycle, continuously in the employ of the Corporation or one of its\\n          subsidiaries, except in the case of death, disability or retirement\\n          under the Corporation\\'s pension plan (including early retirement at\\n\\n                                    E-3-3\\n<PAGE>\\n          the request of the Corporation), in which case (and provided that the\\n          Participant at the time of death, disability or retirement as\\n          aforesaid, shall have been continuously in the employ of the\\n          Corporation or one of its subsidiaries during the period commencing\\n          on the date the award was granted and ending on the first anniversary\\n          thereof) the Participant will be entitled to payment (such payment to\\n          be made in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 6(d)) of the\\n          same portion of the Payment Value of the award the Participant would\\n          otherwise have been paid (such Payment Value, if any, to be\\n          determined at the conclusion of the applicable Award Cycle in\\n          accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 6(a) and 6(e)) as the\\n          portion of the Award Cycle during which the Participant was employed\\n          bears to the full Award Cycle.  Under particular circumstances the\\n          Committee may make other determinations with respect to Participants\\n          whose services do not meet the foregoing requirements, including the\\n          waiver of any of the requirements of this subparagraph (c) relating\\n          to periods of employment.\\n\\n     (d)  Unless the Committee otherwise determines, no payment with respect to\\n          performance units will be made to a Participant prior to the end of\\n          such Participant\\'s Award Cycle; provided, however, that if a\\n          Participant should die during an Award Cycle and the Participant\\'s\\n          award shall not have been terminated hereunder prior to death, such\\n          Participant\\'s Designated Beneficiary may elect instead, subject to\\n          the approval of the Committee, to have the pro rata portion of the\\n          Payment Value determined by the Committee as of the end of the year\\n          during which such Participant\\'s death occurred, based upon\\n          application of the Payment Schedule to the part of the Award Cycle\\n          which shall have elapsed (for such purpose, the cumulative growth\\n          rate achieved to the end of the fiscal year in which death occurs\\n          will be assumed to continue for the Award Cycle), in which event such\\n          pro rata portion shall be paid in cash or Common Stock, as provided\\n          in paragraph 6(g), as soon as practicable following such year (or in\\n          such number of installments as shall have been requested by the\\n          Participant and approved by the Committee) to such Participant\\'s\\n          Designated Beneficiary.\\n\\n     (e)  Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 6(d) in the case of death,\\n          a Participant\\'s interest in any performance units awarded to the\\n          Participant shall mature on the last day of the Award Cycle for such\\n          award.  The Payment Value of a performance unit shall be the dollar\\n          amount calculated on the basis of the Payment Schedule applicable to\\n          such Award Cycle.\\n\\n     (f)  The total amount of Payment Value due a Participant at the conclusion\\n          of an Award Cycle shall be paid on such date following the conclusion\\n          of such Award Cycle as the Committee shall designate, except as\\n          specifically otherwise provided in the Plan; provided, however, that\\n          the Committee shall have authority, if it deems appropriate, to defer\\n          payment (in cash or in stock or both in specified percentages) of the\\n          Payment Value due a Participant if the Participant shall request the\\n          Committee to do so at any time prior to the 180th day preceding the\\n          last day of the Award Cycle for such award.  In respect of awards\\n          made or to be made in one or more deferred installments in cash,\\n          interest shall be credited semi-annually on each such award at a rate\\n          to be determined semi-annually by the Committee, but in no event\\n          shall such rate be less than the average rate on 10-year AAA new\\n          industrial corporate bonds during each such semi-annual period as\\n\\n                                    E-3-4\\n<PAGE>\\n          calculated on the basis of the average of such rates for each\\n          calendar week ending during the period January 1 through June 30 and\\n          July 1 through December 31, provided that awards made during any such\\n          six-month period shall be credited on the basis of the average rate\\n          for that period and provided that installments paid during any such\\n          six-month period shall be credited on the basis of the average rate\\n          for the next preceding six-month period, in each case adjusted for\\n          the number of days such award was to be credited.  Unless paid to the\\n          recipient of such award at the time credited, interest at the\\n          foregoing rate shall be credited on the interest so credited until so\\n          paid. The foregoing minimum interest rate for any award that is\\n          payable in one or more deferred installments under the Plan may not\\n          be modified without the prior written consent of the Participant.\\n\\n          Whenever an award is made in one or more deferred installments in\\n          stock, the Committee may determine that there shall be credited on\\n          such award an amount equivalent to the dividends which would have\\n          been paid with respect to such shares of stock if they had been\\n          issued and outstanding.  Such dividend equivalents shall be credited\\n          on the dividend record dates until certificates for such shares shall\\n          have been delivered to the recipient of such award or until such\\n          earlier date as the Committee may determine.\\n\\n          Such interest and dividend equivalents shall be paid to the recipient\\n          of any such award in cash (or in property if the related dividend\\n          shall have been in property) at such time or times during the\\n          deferred period of such award or at the same time as the cash or\\n          shares of stock to which such interest and dividend equivalents\\n          apply, all as the Committee shall determine.  The Committee may also\\n          determine that any such dividend equivalents may be used to purchase\\n          additional shares of outstanding stock (such shares to be valued for\\n          such purpose at the mean of the high and low sales prices of such\\n          stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the dividend record date) to\\n          be added to the shares of stock covered by such award and held\\n          subject to the same terms and conditions, including provisions\\n          relating to the payment of amounts equivalent to dividends thereon.\\n\\n     (g)  Payment of the Payment Value due a Participant shall be made, at the\\n          election of the Committee as to each Participant, (i) in cash, (ii)\\n          in shares of Common Stock of the Corporation (to be determined by\\n          dividing the Payment Value of all matured performance units by the\\n          average of the high and low sales prices of such stock on the New\\n          York Stock Exchange during the five trading days immediately\\n          preceding the date of payment) or (iii) in a combination of cash and\\n          shares of Common Stock so valued.\\n\\n     (h)  If the payment of any award shall be deferred until after the\\n          termination of the employment of the recipient by the Corporation or\\n          one of its subsidiaries, the cash or stock covered by such award,\\n          together with any deferred interest or dividend equivalents thereon,\\n          shall be delivered in not more than 20 annual installments,\\n          commencing not later than the January 31 after the termination of\\n          employment (or such other date as the Committee from time to time\\n          shall determine), all as the Committee may determine. If the payment\\n          of an award under the Plan is deferred, such payment thereafter may\\n          be accelerated so that such payment shall be made immediately or at\\n          such earlier time or in such lesser number of installments, in each\\n          case as the Committee may from time to time determine, but only with\\n\\n                                    E-3-5\\n<PAGE>\\n          the prior written consent of the Participant.\\n\\n     (i)  A person to whom any payment in consideration of an award has been\\n          made (whether or not the same has been deferred) shall not have any\\n          interest in the cash or stock awarded, or in any interest or dividend\\n          equivalents credited, until the cash has been paid or the\\n          certificates for the stock have been delivered, as the case may be,\\n          in accordance with the provisions of this Plan.\\n\\n     (j)  In the event of any changes in the outstanding stock of the\\n          Corporation by reason of stock dividends, stock splits,\\n          recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations or exchanges\\n          of shares, split-ups, split-offs, spin-offs, liquidations or other\\n          similar changes in capitalization, or any distribution to\\n          shareholders other than cash dividends, the Committee shall make such\\n          adjustments, if any, in the light of the change or distribution as\\n          the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine to be\\n          appropriate, (i) in the number of shares of stock covered by any\\n          award for which certificates have not been delivered and (ii) in any\\n          dividend equivalents to which deferred awards of stock are entitled.\\n\\n     (k)  The recipient of a deferred award may file with the Committee a\\n          designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries on a form to be\\n          provided by the Committee, which designation may be changed or\\n          revoked by the recipient\\'s sole action, provided the change or\\n          revocation is filed with the Committee on a form provided by it.  In\\n          the case of the death of the recipient of an award, before or after\\n          the termination of employment, any unpaid installments of such\\n          deferred award shall pass to the Designated Beneficiary. Unpaid\\n          installments of a deferred award shall be paid either in the same\\n          installments as originally provided or otherwise as the Committee may\\n          determine in individual cases.\\n\\n     (l)  The Corporation shall have the right, in lieu of delivering the\\n          certificate or certificates for any of or all the stock which would\\n          otherwise be deliverable to the Participant pursuant to this Plan, to\\n          pay to such Participant on the date on which such certificate or\\n          certificates would otherwise be deliverable an amount in cash equal\\n          to the mean of the high and low sales prices of such stock on the New\\n          York Stock Exchange on such date or dates as may be determined by the\\n          Committee, but not more than five trading days prior to such date,\\n          and after withholding or deducting any required amount of tax, all as\\n          the Committee may determine in individual cases.\\n\\n7.   Option Grants.\\n\\n     (a)  The purchase price of the Common Stock under each option granted\\n          under the Plan shall be determined by the Committee, but shall be not\\n          less than 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the time such\\n          option is granted.  Such fair market value shall be determined by the\\n          Committee and shall be taken at not less than the mean (rounded to\\n          the next highest cent in the case of fractions of a cent) of the high\\n          and low prices of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on\\n          the date of the grant of the option.\\n\\n     (b)  The Committee shall be authorized in its discretion to prescribe in\\n          the option grant the installments, if any, in which an option granted\\n          under the Plan shall become exercisable, provided that no option\\n\\n                                    E-3-6\\n<PAGE>\\n          shall be exercisable, prior to the first anniversary of the date of\\n          grant thereof except as provided in Paragraph 7(e) or except as the\\n          Committee otherwise determines. In no case may an option be exercised\\n          as to less than 10 shares at any one time (or the remaining shares\\n          covered by the option if less than 10) during the term of the option.\\n          The Committee shall also be authorized to establish the manner and\\n          the effective date of the exercise of an option. The term of each\\n          option shall be not more than ten years from the date of grant\\n          thereof, or such shorter period as is prescribed in Paragraphs 7(d)\\n          and (e). Except as provided in Paragraphs 7(d) and (e), no option may\\n          be exercised at any time unless the holder thereof is then an\\n          employee of the Corporation or of a subsidiary.\\n\\n          Upon exercise, the option price is to be paid in full in cash or, at\\n          the discretion of the Committee, in shares of Common Stock owned by\\n          the optionee having a market value on the date of exercise equal to\\n          the aggregate option price, or, at the discretion of the Committee,\\n          in a combination of cash and such shares of Common Stock; provided,\\n          however, that no such payment in shares of Common Stock shall be made\\n          unless said shares shall have been owned by the optionee for a period\\n          of at least three months prior to the date of payment.  For purposes\\n          of this paragraph, the market value of shares of Common Stock\\n          delivered in payment of the option price shall be the mean between\\n          the highest and lowest selling prices per share of Common Stock on\\n          the New York Stock Exchange on the exercise date; if shares of Common\\n          Stock are not traded on the exercise date, the fair market value on\\n          such date shall be determined under Treasury Regulation section\\n          20.2031-2.  For purposes of this paragraph, an optionee can effect\\n          delivery of shares of Common Stock by delivering certificates for\\n          such shares to the Corporation, by furnishing the Corporation the\\n          registration numbers on the certificates for such shares or, if such\\n          shares are held of record by a nominee for the benefit of the\\n          optionee, by furnishing the Corporation a notarized statement\\n          attesting to the number of such shares the optionee intends to be\\n          delivered.\\n\\n          On such terms and conditions as shall be approved by the Committee,\\n          the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries may directly or indirectly\\n          lend money to any optionee or other person to accomplish the purposes\\n          of the Plan, including to assist such person to acquire shares of\\n          Common Stock acquired upon the exercise of options, and separately to\\n          tend money to any optionee or other lend person to pay taxes with\\n          respect to any of the transactions contemplated by the Plan.\\n\\n          In lieu of requiring an optionee to pay cash and/or stock, and\\n          receive certificates for shares of Common Stock of the Corporation\\n          upon the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option, as hereinafter\\n          defined, if the option so provides, the Committee may elect to\\n          require the optionee to surrender the option to the Corporation for\\n          cancellation as to all or any portion of the number of shares covered\\n          by the intended exercise and receive in exchange for such surrender a\\n          payment, at the election of the Committee, in cash, in shares of\\n          Common Stock of the Corporation, or a combination of cash and shares\\n          of Common Stock of the Corporation, equivalent to the appreciated\\n          value of the shares covered by the option surrendered for\\n          cancellation.  Such appreciated value shall be the difference between\\n          the option price of such shares (as adjusted pursuant to Paragraph\\n          10) and the fair market value of such shares which shall be\\n\\n                                    E-3-7\\n<PAGE>\\n          determined by the Committee and shall be taken at not less than the\\n          mean of the high and low prices of the Common Stock on the New York\\n          Stock Exchange on the date on which the optionee\\'s notice of exercise\\n          is received by the Corporation.  Upon delivery to the Corporation of\\n          a notice of exercise of option, the Committee may avail itself of its\\n          right to require the optionee to surrender the option to the\\n          Corporation for cancellation as to shares covered by such intended\\n          exercise. The Committee\\'s right of election shall (i) be conditional\\n          upon its so notifying the optionee in writing immediately on the date\\n          of the Corporation\\'s receipt of the optionee\\'s notice of exercise and\\n          (ii) expired, if not exercised, at the close of business on the fifth\\n          business day following the delivery to the Corporation of such\\n          notice.  Should the Committee not exercise such right of election,\\n          the delivery of the aforesaid notice of exercise shall constitute an\\n          exercise by the optionee of the option to the extent therein set\\n          forth, and payment for the shares covered by such exercise shall then\\n          become due.\\n\\n     (c)  In the event that an individual receiving a Non-Qualified Stock\\n          Option, as hereinafter defined, shall not remain in the employ of the\\n          Corporation or of one of its subsidiaries for a period of at least\\n          one year from the date of grant of the option and the termination of\\n          such individual\\'s service during such period is either (i) for cause\\n          or (ii) voluntary on the part of such individual and without the\\n          written consent of the Corporation or such subsidiary, the option\\n          shall forthwith terminate on the date of such termination of\\n          employment.  Retirement at the early or normal retirement date as\\n          prescribed from time to time by the Corporation shall be deemed to be\\n          a termination of employment with the Corporation\\'s written consent.\\n          An individual receiving an Incentive Stock Option, as hereinafter\\n          defined, may exercise it only after one year of employment following\\n          the grant date (and then only to the extent provided in the option\\n          grant) and termination of such employment in such one-year period\\n          will terminate all rights under such option.\\n\\n     (d)  In the event of the termination of the employment of the holder of\\n          any option, other than by reason of normal or early retirement in\\n          accordance with the provisions of a pension plan of the Corporation\\n          or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates (hereinafter \"Retirement\"),\\n          or death, the optionee may (unless the option shall have been\\n          previously terminated pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7(c) or\\n          unless otherwise provided in the option grant) exercise the option at\\n          any time within three months after such termination, but not after\\n          the expiration of the option, to the extent of the number of shares\\n          covered by the option which were purchasable by the optionee at the\\n          date of the termination of employment.\\n\\n          In the event of the termination of the employment of the holder of\\n          any option because of Retirement before May 5, 1987, the optionee,\\n          may (unless the options shall have been previously terminated\\n          pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7(c) or unless otherwise\\n          provided in the option grant) exercise the option at any time during\\n          the remaining term of the option but not after the expiration of the\\n          option, to the extent of the number of shares covered by the option\\n          which were purchasable by the optionee at the date of termination of\\n          employment.\\n\\n          In the event of the termination of the employment of the holder of\\n\\n                                    E-3-8\\n<PAGE>\\n          any option because of Retirement on or after May 5, 1987, the option\\n          shall (unless the option shall have been previously terminated\\n          pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7(c) or unless otherwise\\n          provided in the option grant) continue to become exercisable in\\n          accordance with its terms and the provisions of this Paragraph 7 and\\n          of the option grant, and the holder thereof may exercise the option\\n          at any time and from time to time during the remaining term thereof,\\n          but not after the expiration of the option, to the extent it is at\\n          such time exercisable; provided, however, that if the holder becomes\\n          employed by a direct competitor of the Corporation or any of its\\n          subsidiaries, any option held by the optionee which is not, on the\\n          date of becoming so employed, fully exercisable shall forthwith\\n          terminate as to all shares not then purchasable by such optionee\\n          thereunder, and, thereafter, such optionee may so exercise the option\\n          only to the extent of the number of shares covered by the option\\n          which were purchased by such optionee at the date of employment by\\n          such direct competitor.\\n\\n          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof but subject to the\\n          provisions of Paragraph 7(c), the Committee may determine, in its\\n          sole discretion, in the case of any termination of employment that\\n          the holder of an option may exercise such option to the extent of the\\n          remaining shares covered thereby whether or not such shares had\\n          become purchasable by such an individual at the date of the\\n          termination of employment. Options granted under the Plan shall not\\n          be affected by any change of employment so long as the holder\\n          continues to be an employee of the Corporation or of a subsidiary.\\n          The option grant may contain such provisions as the Committee may\\n          approve with reference to the effect of approved leaves of absence.\\n          Nothing in the Plan or in any option granted pursuant to the Plan\\n          shall confer on any individual any right to continue in the employ of\\n          the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or interfere in any way\\n          with the right of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to\\n          terminate his employment at any time.\\n\\n     (e)  In the event of the death of an individual to whom an option has been\\n          granted under the Plan while such individual is employed by the\\n          Corporation or a subsidiary, the option theretofore granted (unless\\n          the option shall have been previously terminated pursuant to the\\n          provisions of Paragraph 7(c) or unless otherwise provided in the\\n          option grant) may be exercised by a legatee or legatees of the option\\n          holder under the optionee\\'s last will or by the personal\\n          representatives or distributees of the optionee, (i) if such\\n          individual\\'s death occurs prior to May 5, 1987, at any time within a\\n          period of one year after death or (ii) if such individual\\'s death\\n          occurs on or after May 5, 1987, during the remaining term of the\\n          option, but in neither event after the expiration of the option, to\\n          the extent of the remaining shares covered by the option whether or\\n          not such shares had become purchasable by such an individual at the\\n          date of death.\\n\\n          In the event of the death of an individual during the three-month\\n          period following the termination of employment (where said\\n          termination was for reasons other than Retirement), the option (if\\n          not previously terminated pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph\\n          7(c) or unless otherwise provided in the option grant) may be\\n          exercised by a legatee or legatees of the option holder under the\\n          optionee\\'s last will or by the optionee\\'s personal representatives or\\n\\n                                    E-3-9\\n<PAGE>\\n          distributees but only to the extent of the number of shares\\n          purchasable by such employee pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph\\n          7(d) at the date of termination of the optionee\\'s employment and\\n          within one year after the date of the death, but not after expiration\\n          of the option.\\n\\n          In the event that an individual to whom an option has been granted\\n          under the Plan dies following Retirement, the option theretofore\\n          granted to such individual (if not previously terminated pursuant to\\n          the provisions of Paragraph 7(c) or unless otherwise provided in the\\n          option grant) may be exercised by a legatee or legatees of the option\\n          holder under the optionee\\'s last will, or by the optionee\\'s personal\\n          representatives or distributees, at any time during the remaining\\n          term of the option, but not after expiration of the option, (i) if\\n          Retirement commenced prior to May 5, 1987, only to the extent of the\\n          number of shares purchasable by such individual pursuant to the\\n          provisions of Paragraph 7(d) at the date of termination of employment\\n          or (ii) if Retirement commenced on or after May 5, 1987, to the\\n          extent of the number of shares covered by the option whether or not\\n          such shares had become purchasable by such individual at the date of\\n          death, subject, however, to the limitations described in Paragraph\\n          7(1).\\n\\n     (f)  Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 7(h), the date of grant of an\\n          option pursuant to the Plan shall be the date specified by the\\n          Committee at the time it grants such option, provided that such date\\n          shall not be prior to the date of such action by the Committee. The\\n          Committee shall promptly notify a grantee of an award and a written\\n          option grant shall promptly be duly executed and delivered by or on\\n          behalf of the Corporation.\\n\\n     (g)  The Committee shall be authorized, in its absolute discretion, to\\n          permit optionees to surrender outstanding options in exchange for the\\n          grant of new options or require optionees to surrender outstanding\\n          options as a condition precedent to the grant of new options.  The\\n          number of shares covered by the new options, the option price, the\\n          option period and other terms and conditions of the new options shall\\n          all be determined in accordance with the Plan and may be different\\n          from the provisions of the surrendered options.  However, if an\\n          Incentive Stock Option is surrendered, it will nevertheless be\\n          considered outstanding for purposes of Paragraph 7(h).\\n\\n     (h)  Each option granted or modified hereunder which is intended to be an\\n          Incentive Stock Option (when used herein, the term \"Incentive Stock\\n          Option\" shall be as defined in Section 422A of the United States\\n          Internal Revenue Code and all other options granted hereunder are\\n          referred to as \"Non-Qualified Stock Options\") shall not be\\n          exercisable while there is outstanding any Incentive Stock Option\\n          which was granted, before the granting of such option, to the\\n          optionee to purchase stock in the optionee\\'s employer corporation or\\n          in a corporation which (at the time of the granting of such option)\\n          is a parent or subsidiary of the employer corporation, or is a\\n          predecessor of any of such corporations.  For purposes of this\\n          Paragraph 7(h), an Incentive Stock Option shall be treated as\\n          outstanding until such option is exercised in full or expires by\\n          reason of lapse of time.  In the case of an option which is modified\\n          and which did not meet the requirements applicable to Incentive Stock\\n          Options prior to such modifications but does thereafter, the date of\\n\\n                                    E-3-10\\n<PAGE>\\n          such modification shall be treated as the date of grant for purposes\\n          of this Paragraph 7(h).

Restricted Stock Awards.\\n\\n     (a)  The consideration to be received for shares of Restricted Stock\\n          issued hereunder out of authorized but unissued shares shall be equal\\n          to cash in an amount equal to the par value thereof and the continued\\n          employment by the participant during the \"Restricted Period\" (as\\n          hereafter defined).  The recipient of Restricted Stock shall be\\n          recorded as a stockholder of the Corporation and shall have, subject\\n          to the provisions hereof, all the rights of a stockholder with\\n          respect to such shares and receive all dividends or other\\n          distributions made or paid with respect to such shares; provided that\\n          the shares themselves and any new, additional or different shares or\\n          securities which the recipient may be entitled to receive with\\n          respect to such shares by virtue of a stock split or stock dividend\\n          or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the\\n          Corporation, shall be subject to the restrictions hereinafter\\n          described.\\n\\n     (b)  During a period of years following the date of grant, as determined\\n          by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than four\\n          (hereinafter referred to as the \"Restricted Period\"), the Restricted\\n          Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated\\n          or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the recipient, except in\\n          the event of (i) death as hereinafter provided or (ii) the transfer\\n          thereof to the Corporation under the provisions of the next\\n          succeeding paragraph.  In the event of the death of the recipient\\n          during the said Restricted Period, the aforesaid restrictions on the\\n          Restricted Stock shall immediately lapse and the legal\\n          representative(s) of the estate of the recipient shall be free to\\n          transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock.\\n\\n          In the event that, during the Restricted Period, the employment of\\n          the recipient by the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries is\\n          terminated for any reason (including termination with or without\\n          cause by the Corporation or such subsidiary, resignation by the\\n          recipient, or retirement under a pension plan of the Corporation or\\n\\n                                    E-3-11\\n<PAGE>\\n          one of its subsidiaries), other than termination of employment due to\\n          the death of the recipient, then the shares of Restricted Stock held\\n          by such recipient shall be forfeited to the Corporation and the\\n          recipient shall immediately transfer and return to the Corporation\\n          the certificates representing all the Restricted Stock and the\\n          recipient\\'s rights as a stockholder with respect to the Restricted\\n          Stock shall cease, effective with such termination of employment.\\n\\n          The recipient\\'s rights to the Restricted Stock may not be assigned or\\n          transferred except by will or by the laws of descent or distribution.\\n          In the event of any attempt to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge or\\n          otherwise dispose of said shares by the recipient in violation of the\\n          provisions hereof, such shares shall be forfeited to the Corporation.\\n\\n     (c)  The Committee shall have authority, if it deems appropriate, to\\n          extend the Restricted Period with respect to any award of Restricted\\n          Stock if the recipient shall request the Committee to do so at any\\n          time prior to the 180th day preceding the date on which the\\n          Restricted Period is originally scheduled to lapse.  In the event\\n          that the Restricted Period is so extended (the \"Extended Restricted\\n          Period\") until after the termination of the employment of the\\n          recipient by the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries, the\\n          restrictions on the Restricted Stock shall lapse in not more than\\n          twenty annual installments, commencing not later than the January 31\\n          after the termination of employment (or such other date as the\\n          Committee from time to time shall determine), all as the Committee\\n          may determine.  If the Restricted Period is so extended, such lapsing\\n          of restrictions thereafter may be accelerated so that all such\\n          restrictions shall lapse immediately or at such earlier time or in\\n          such less number of installments, in each case as the Committee may\\n          from time to time determine, but only with the prior written consent\\n          of the recipient.  In the event of the death of the recipient during\\n          the Extended Restricted Period, all restrictions on the Restricted\\n          Stock shall immediately lapse and the legal representative(s) of the\\n          estate of the recipient shall be free to transfer, encumber or\\n          otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock.\\n\\n9.   Transferability and Shareholder Rights of Holders of Performance Units and\\n     Options.\\n\\n     No performance unit awarded and no option granted under the Plan shall be\\n     transferable otherwise than pursuant to Paragraph 6(k) or by will or by\\n     the laws of descent and distribution, and an option may be exercised,\\n     during the lifetime of the holder thereof, only by such holder.  The\\n     holder of a performance unit award or of an option shall have none of the\\n     rights of a shareholder until (i) in the case of performance unit awards,\\n     the recipient has an interest therein in accordance with Paragraph 6(i),\\n     or (ii) in the case of options, the shares subject thereto shall have been\\n     registered in the name of the person or persons exercising such option on\\n     the transfer books of the Corporation upon such exercise.\\n\\n10.  Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization.\\n\\n     Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the option grants may\\n     contain such provisions as the Committee may determine as appropriate for\\n     the adjustment of the number and class of shares subject to the options\\n     and the option prices of the options covered thereby, in the event of\\n\\n                                    E-3-12\\n<PAGE>\\n     changes in the outstanding Common Stock by reason of stock dividends,\\n     stock splits, recapitalizations, merger & consolidations, combinations, or\\n     exchanges of shares, split-ups, split-offs, spin-offs, liquidations or\\n     other similar changes in capitalization, or any distribution to common\\n     shareholders other than cash dividends, and, in the event of any such\\n     change in the outstanding Common Stock, the aggregate number and class of\\n     shares available under the Plan and the maximum number of shares as to\\n     which options may be granted and performance units awarded and the maximum\\n     number of shares of Restricted Stock which may be awarded shall be\\n     appropriately adjusted by the Committee.\\n\\n11.

Purpose of the Plan\\n     -------------------\\n     The purpose of this Plan is to provide benefits for certain employees\\n     participating in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Retirement Income Plan\\n     (the \"Retirement Income Plan\") or the Bristol-Myers Squibb Puerto Rico,\\n     Inc. Retirement Income Plan (the \"Puerto Rico Plan\") (referred to herein\\n     collectively as the \"Retirement Plans\") whose funded benefits under the\\n     Retirement Plans are or will be limited by application of the Employee\\n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\") and the\\n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\").  The Plan is\\n     intended to be an \"excess benefit plan\" as that term is defined in Section\\n     3(36) of ERISA with respect to those participants whose benefits under the\\n     Retirement Plans have been limited by Section 415 of the Code, and a \"top\\n     hat\" plan meeting the requirements of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3),\\n     401(a)(1) and 4021(b)(6) of ERISA with respect to those participants whose\\n     benefits under the Retirement Plans have been limited by Section\\n     401(a)(17) of the Code and with respect to certain employees covered by\\n     the Squibb Corporation Supplementary Pension Plan (the \"Squibb Plan\") on\\n     December 31, 1990.

All amounts accrued under Part IV of the\\n     Prior Plan continue to be accrued under this Plan.\\n\\n     Effective as of January 1, 1991, the Plan assumed the liabilities for all\\n     benefits payable under the Squibb Plan with respect to all active and\\n     former employees (other than foreign employees) which had accrued as of\\n     December 31, 1990, with respect to benefits provided under the Squibb Plan\\n     other than benefits due to a Squibb employee\\'s election to defer an annual\\n     incentive award or benefits payable to foreign employees of Squibb.\\n     Therefore, this Plan is a continuation and successor plan to the Squibb\\n     Plan with respect to all such benefits accrued thereunder prior to\\n     January 1, 1991 with respect to employees who participated in the Squibb\\n     Corporation Pension Plan.  Employees who were participants in the Squibb\\n     Plan who accrue benefits under this Plan on or after January 1, 1991,\\n     shall be entitled to the benefits provided by this Plan with respect to\\n     all service covered under either the Retirement Income Plan or the Puerto\\n     Rico Plan.\\n\\n\\n                                    E-6-1\\n<PAGE>\\nII.

The Committee shall\\n     have full authority to determine all questions arising in connection with\\n     the Plan, including its interpretation, may adopt procedural rules, and\\n     may employ and rely on such legal counsel, such actuaries, such\\n     accountants and such agents as it may deem advisable to assist in the\\n     administration of the Plan.  Decisions of the Committee shall be\\n     conclusive and binding on all persons.\\n\\nIII. Participation in the Plan\\n     -------------------------\\n     Each member of the Retirement Income Plan or the Puerto Rico Plan who is\\n     employed by a corporation participating in either Retirement Plan\\n     (hereinafter referred to as a \"participating employer\" which term also\\n     includes the Company) shall be eligible to participate in this Plan\\n     whenever (a) his benefit under the applicable Retirement Plan, as from\\n     time to time in effect, would exceed the limitations on benefits and\\n     contributions imposed by Section 415 of the Code calculated from and after\\n     September 2, 1974, (b) amounts of his compensation would be excluded from\\n     his \"Final Average Compensation\" determined under the Retirement Plan by\\n     reason of the application of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code or (c) he\\n     participates in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Performance Incentive\\n     Plan (the \"Performance Incentive Plan\").\\n\\nIV.

BUSINESS\\n\\n  (A) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS\\n\\nSUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON\\n- ------------------------------\\nChevron Corporation(1), a Delaware corporation, provides administrative,\\nfinancial and management support for, and manages its investments in, U.S. and\\nforeign subsidiaries and affiliates, which engage in fully integrated petroleum\\noperations, chemical operations and coal mining in the United States and\\napproximately 95 other countries. Petroleum operations consist of exploring for,\\ndeveloping and producing crude oil and natural gas; transporting crude oil,\\nnatural gas and petroleum products by pipelines, marine vessels and motor\\nequipment; refining crude oil into finished petroleum products; and marketing\\ncrude oil, natural gas and the many products derived from petroleum. Chemical\\noperations include the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of chemicals\\nfor industrial uses.\\n\\nIncorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the\\ncompany adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984. U.S. integrated petroleum\\noperations are conducted primarily through three divisions of the company\\'s\\nwholly owned Chevron U.S.A. Inc. subsidiary. Exploration and production\\n(\"upstream\") operations in the United States are carried out through Chevron\\nU.S.A. Production Company. U.S. refining and marketing (\"downstream\") activities\\nare performed by Chevron Products Company (formerly Chevron U.S.A. Products\\nCompany). Warren Petroleum Company engages in all phases of the U.S. natural gas\\nliquids business. In January 1996, the company announced that it had entered\\ninto exclusive negotiations to merge certain operations of Chevron U.S.A.\\nProduction Company and Warren Petroleum Company with those of NGC Corporation.\\nAdditional details of this proposed merger are disclosed on pages 4 and 16 of\\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nA list of the company\\'s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-2 of this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 1995, Chevron had 43,019\\nemployees, 76 percent of whom were employed in U.S. operations.\\n\\nOVERVIEW OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY\\n- ------------------------------\\nPetroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by a large number\\nof factors, over some of which individual oil and gas companies have little\\ncontrol. Governmental attitudes and policies, particularly in the areas of\\ntaxation, energy and the environment, have a significant impact on petroleum\\nactivities, regulating where and how companies conduct their operations and\\nformulate their products and, in some cases, limiting their profits directly.\\nPrices for crude oil and natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are\\ndetermined by supply and demand for these commodities. OPEC member countries are\\nthe world\\'s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are the\\nprimary driver in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its\\nproducts and natural gas is largely driven by the health of local, national and\\nworldwide economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other\\nenergy sources also play a significant part. Natural gas is generally produced\\nand consumed on a country or regional basis. Its largest use is for electrical\\ngeneration, where it competes with other energy fuels.\\n\\nCURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\\n- -----------------------------\\nCrude oil prices trended upwards throughout most of the first half of 1995 due\\nto concerns of possible U.S. sanctions against certain oil producing countries,\\nlow crude oil inventories (caused by U.S. refiners\\' purchases of crude oil in\\nanticipation of the upcoming driving season) and strong demand in Asia. At\\nOPEC\\'s June meeting,\\n\\n- ---------------------\\n(1) As used in this report, the term \"Chevron\" and such terms as \"the company,\"\\n\"the corporation,\" \"our,\" \"we,\" and \"us\" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one\\nor more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or to all of them taken as a whole,\\nbut unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, should not be read to\\ninclude \"affiliates\" of Chevron (those companies owned approximately 50 percent\\nor less).\\n\\nAs used in this report, the term \"Caltex\" may refer to the Caltex Group of\\ncompanies, any one company of the group, any of their consolidated subsidiaries,\\nor to all of them taken as a whole and also includes the \"affiliates\" of Caltex.\\n\\nAll of these terms are used for convenience only, and are not intended as a\\nprecise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its\\nown affairs.\\n\\n                                    - 1 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nmembers agreed to maintain their 24.5 million barrels per day production quota\\nfor the remainder of 1995. However, the cartel also signaled its desire to\\nregain market-share from non-OPEC producers in 1996, which the market perceived\\nas a change in OPEC\\'s focus from price support to volume gains. This perception\\ncaused crude prices to weaken until late November when unusually cold weather in\\nthe northern United States increased demand. The company\\'s average crude oil\\nrealizations in the United States for 1995 finished $1.48 per barrel higher than\\nin the previous year.\\n\\nContinued concerns of high storage levels coupled with a mild winter in most\\nparts of the United States resulted in depressed U.S. natural gas prices for the\\nfirst half of 1995. Prices began to rebound in late August due to hot summer\\nweather in some key gas-consuming regions in the United States and fears of\\nplatform damages during 1995\\'s active hurricane season. Gas prices continued to\\nrise dramatically in November and December as cold weather in the northern\\nUnited States increased demand for heating fuel. For the month of December, the\\nHenry Hub, Louisiana spot price for natural gas, a common benchmark for natural\\ngas prices, averaged $2.45 per thousand cubic feet (MCF), its highest December\\nlevel for Gulf Coast gas in more than 10 years. However, this late surge was\\nunable to reverse the effects of low gas prices earlier in the year and the\\nHenry Hub spot price for natural gas averaged $1.69 per MCF in 1995, a decrease\\nof 17 cents from 1994.\\n\\nThe company\\'s average realization from U.S. crude oil production increased to\\n$15.34 per barrel in 1995 from $13.86 in 1994 while average liquids realizations\\nfrom international liftings, including equity affiliates, increased $1.24 per\\nbarrel to $16.10. Average U.S. natural gas realizations from production\\ndecreased to $1.51 per MCF in 1995 from $1.77 in 1994.\\n\\nThe following table compares the high, low and average Chevron posted prices for\\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI), an industry benchmark light crude oil, for each\\nof the quarters during 1995 and for the full years of 1995, 1994, and 1993:\\n\\n      ------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                        WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE CRUDE OIL\\n                              CHEVRON POSTED PRICES\\n                               (Dollars per Barrel)\\n\\n                                1995\\n                  ------------------------------------\\n                  1st Q  2nd Q  3rd Q   4th Q     Year     1994     1993\\n                  -----  -----  -----   -----    -----    -----    -----\\n      High        18.25  19.50  18.00   18.75    19.50    19.75    20.25\\n      Low         16.50  16.50  16.00   16.00    16.00    13.00    13.00\\n      Average     17.36  18.33  16.76   17.16    17.40    16.18    17.68\\n\\n      ------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFor the first two months of 1996, average natural gas realizations for the\\ncompany\\'s U.S. operations were $2.23 per MCF. During this period, the company\\'s\\nposted price for WTI ranged from $16.50 per barrel to $19.25, with an average of\\n$17.73. On March 20, 1996 the company\\'s posted price for WTI was $22.00 per\\nbarrel.\\n\\nChevron\\'s refining and marketing operations in the United States were hampered\\nby extensive refinery downtime and weak industry refinery margins in 1995.\\nUnscheduled downtime and major maintenance turnarounds at the company\\'s three\\nlargest refineries required the company to purchase higher cost refined products\\nfrom third parties to supply the company\\'s marketing system. In addition, the\\ncompany\\'s Richmond, California, refinery was down for an extended period of time\\nlate in the year for upgrades required to produce cleaner-burning gasoline that\\nmeets California\\'s stringent emission requirements. By June 1, 1996 gasoline\\nsold at service stations in California must meet this new requirement. The\\ncompany\\'s average sales price per barrel of refined product was $26.19 per\\nbarrel in 1995, an increase of $1.82 per barrel over 1994. However, most of this\\nincrease reflected higher crude oil feedstock cost and the added cost of\\nproducing federally mandated reformulated gasoline as industry refining margins\\nremained weak throughout much of the year due to ample product availability.\\n\\n                                    - 2 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nThe company\\'s chemical operations reported record earnings for the year as\\nimproving worldwide economies continued to spur demand for the company\\'s\\ncommodity chemicals through the first half of 1995. However, industry conditions\\nsoftened during the second half of 1995 as the industry began to strike a\\nbalance between supply and demand. The company does not expect that 1996\\nchemicals results will be as strong as 1995\\'s. Sales and other operating\\nrevenues from the company\\'s chemical operations, including sales to other\\nChevron companies, totaled $3.953 billion, an increase of $591 million over the\\n$3.362 billion recorded in 1994.\\n\\nCHEVRON STRATEGIC DIRECTION\\n- ---------------------------\\nSince 1992, the company has developed and implemented certain strategies to\\nimprove its financial performance and to support Chevron\\'s mission to create\\nsuperior value for its stockholders, customers and employees. The company\\nperiodically reviews and modifies these \"strategic intents\" to reflect Chevron\\'s\\ncurrent operating environment. The eight \"strategic intents\" for 1996 are:\\n\\n- -  BUILD A COMMITTED TEAM TO ACCOMPLISH THE CORPORATE MISSION. The success of\\n   the other seven strategic intents is strongly linked to the level of\\n   commitment and dedication that Chevron employees bring to their jobs. In\\n   1995, the company issued a new document to each employee. This document, \"The\\n   Chevron Way,\" contains the company\\'s Mission and Vision and other key\\n   statements - Committed Team Values, Total Quality Management, Protecting\\n   People and the Environment and Vision Metrics - that establish a vision and\\n   standard of excellence for each employee. The company has also made efforts\\n   to measure employees\\' attitudes about the company and diagnose areas of\\n   employee concerns over the past four years by the use of the Worldwide\\n   Employee Survey. As a result, many programs, including leadership training,\\n   upward feedback and the process of filling open jobs, have been developed or\\n   revamped to address those concerns. In addition, the company has put an\\n   increased emphasis on people skills in supervisor positions.\\n\\n   The company is also fostering employee commitment by sharing its success. In\\n   January 1995 the company announced a new program called \"Chevron Success\\n   Sharing,\" that provides eligible employees with a cash bonus if the company\\n   achieves certain financial goals. The total payout opportunity under the\\n   program is 8 percent of the employee\\'s salary. No payout was made in 1995. As\\n   an extra enticement to achieve 1994 through 1998 financial targets, the\\n   company announced that each eligible employee on the payroll as of January\\n   31, 1996 has been awarded 150 special performance stock options. The grant\\n   price was set at $51-7/8 and the options are exercisable, after a six-month\\n   holding period, on the business day after the stock price hits $75 or higher\\n   for three consecutive days or Chevron ranks number one in total shareholder\\n   return versus its five major U.S. competitors for the period 1994 through\\n   1998. If neither criteria is met, the options expire and have no value.\\n\\n- -  FOCUS ON REDUCING COSTS ACROSS ALL ACTIVITIES. Operating expenses, adjusted\\n   for special items, declined about $300 million in 1995 from 1994. Compared to\\n   1991, the base measurement year established when Chevron undertook an\\n   extensive cost-cutting and work force reduction program in early 1992,\\n   operating expenses in 1995 have declined about $1.3 billion. Although a\\n   portion of the cost reduction is related to divested operations, the company\\n   believes the majority is the result of a permanent reduction in the company\\'s\\n   ongoing cost structure.\\n\\n   The company is currently implementing reorganizations that will reduce the\\n   costs of two of its operating companies, Chevron Products Company and Chevron\\n   Chemical Company, and two of its departments, Human Resources and Finance, by\\n   consolidating support functions and regional offices and outsourcing certain\\n   job functions. Chevron also sold its office building in Denver in January\\n   1996 as part of the company\\'s efforts to cut costs and reduce surplus office\\n   space. A corporatewide \"breakthrough\" initiative aimed at reducing corporate\\n   energy costs has saved approximately $440 million since 1992. An additional\\n   $100 million has been saved since 1994 through a breakthrough initiative\\n   focusing on reducing goods and services costs by working more efficiently\\n   with fewer suppliers. Two other breakthrough initiatives have saved\\n   additional millions by creating a uniform project management process that is\\n   used to evaluate and administer large capital projects and improving\\n   inventory management in order to avoid tying up working capital in excessive\\n   inventories.\\n\\n- -  CONTINUE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL AREAS. The\\n   company continues to believe that its most promising area of financial and\\n   operational growth is in its international upstream activities. As a result,\\n  \\n                                    - 3 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n   the company has focused its exploration and production (E&P) efforts outside\\n   the United States. Between 1990 and 1995, total capital and exploratory (C&E)\\n   expenditures for E&P activities grew by 19 percent, however during this same\\n   time period, international expenditures grew by 68 percent while U.S.\\n   expenditures declined by 25 percent. In 1990, international expenditures were\\n   less than half (48 percent) of the total C&E expenditures related to E&P\\n   activities. By 1995 that number had climbed to 68 percent and is estimated at\\n   65 percent in 1996. As a measure of its success in growing its international\\n   upstream business, the company\\'s year end 1995 international net proved\\n   reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas have almost\\n   doubled since 1990, while international production has increased\\n   approximately 36 percent during this same time period.\\n\\n- -  GENERATE CASH FROM NORTH AMERICAN UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WHILE MAINTAINING VALUE\\n   THROUGH SUSTAINED PRODUCTION LEVELS. For 1995, this strategic intent was to\\n   \"Generate greater than $800 million a year in cash from U.S. exploration and\\n   production.\" Net cash flow, after capital and exploratory expenditures, for\\n   U.S. E&P operations of $672 million in 1995 fell short of the goal as higher\\n   crude oil prices were more than offset by lower production volumes, lower\\n   natural gas prices and increased capital spending. The company has several\\n   projects under way, including major development projects in the Gulf of\\n   Mexico, Texas and California that are expected to stabilize the company\\'s\\n   U.S. oil and gas production. Recognizing that opportunities to discover and\\n   develop major new reserves in the United States are limited due to regulatory\\n   barriers and drilling prohibitions in many of the most promising areas of\\n   development, the company nonetheless believes that it should be able to\\n   maintain its U.S. production through the development of attractive growth\\n   opportunities within the company\\'s current portfolio of assets, such as the\\n   acceleration and expansion of deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico, and,\\n   if attractive opportunities arise, through acquisitions and trades.\\n   Accordingly, the company has increased its U.S. capital and exploratory\\n   budget in this area and has reduced its cash generation goal for North\\n   American operations.\\n\\n   In January 1996, as part of the company\\'s efforts to enhance the value of its\\n   North American upstream assets, the company announced that it had entered\\n   into exclusive negotiations to merge certain gas gathering, processing, and\\n   marketing operations of Chevron U.S.A. Production Company\\'s Natural Gas\\n   Business Unit and Warren Petroleum Company with those of NGC Corporation. The\\n   company believes the merger will reduce costs through economies of scale and\\n   will position these activities for greater growth.\\n\\n- -  ACHIEVE TOP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN U.S. REFINING AND MARKETING. Over the\\n   past few years, the company has focused its attention on reshaping its\\n   refining portfolio by selling refineries in Port Arthur, Texas and\\n   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and spending over $1 billion on its two California\\n   refineries in order to produce cleaner-burning fuels and to increase their\\n   efficiency and reliability. In 1995, refinery downtime due to these upgrades,\\n   as well as unscheduled refinery downtime and weak industry margins, caused a\\n   77 percent drop in earnings, excluding special items. With the reshaping of\\n   its refinery portfolio largely completed in 1995, the company expects U.S.\\n   refining and marketing results to improve in 1996 with improved refinery\\n   utilization. The company will be shifting the majority of its 1996 investment\\n   spending to marketing projects aimed at meeting customers\\' needs and\\n   improving the company\\'s competitive market position.\\n\\n- -  GROW CALTEX IN ATTRACTIVE MARKETS WHILE ACHIEVING SUPERIOR COMPETITIVE\\n   FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. The company believes that the Asia-Pacific region will\\n   continue to be an area of strong demand growth for petroleum products.\\n   Chevron\\'s 50 percent owned Caltex affiliate, a leading competitor in these\\n   areas, has and is continuing to make significant capital investments to\\n   expand and upgrade its refining capacity and its retail marketing systems. A\\n   large refinery upgrade and expansion project is continuing in Korea, and\\n   first production from a new refinery in Thailand is expected in mid-1996. In\\n   China, Caltex formed a joint venture with a state-owned enterprise to build\\n   the country\\'s largest liquid petroleum gas terminal and blending and storage\\n   facility. Many of Caltex\\'s 4,200 branded service stations will receive a new\\n   retail image over the next five years in order to build a stronger brand\\n   identity.\\n\\n   In 1995, Caltex merged the refining and marketing assets of Caltex Australia\\n   Limited, a 75 percent owned subsidiary, with those of Ampol Limited to form\\n   Australian Petroleum Pty. Limited. The merger is expected to improve\\n   efficiencies, reduce costs and increase market share in Australia. Caltex has\\n   a 37.5 percent equity interest in the new company. In December 1995, Caltex\\n   also announced that it is selling its 50 percent interest\\n\\n                                    - 4 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n   in Nippon Petroleum Refining Company, Limited in Japan to its partner, Nippon\\n   Oil Company, Limited for $2 billion as part of the company\\'s efforts to\\n   restructure in mature markets and to provide capital for investments in\\n   higher growth areas in the Asia-Pacific region.\\n\\n- -  CONTINUE TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN CHEMICALS WHILE\\n   DEVELOPING ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH. Financial results for the\\n   company\\'s chemical operations continued to improve significantly in 1995 as\\n   the demand for chemicals outpaced supplies in the first half of 1995 before\\n   industry conditions began to soften later in the year. Chevron Chemical\\n   Company reported record operational earnings of $524 million in 1995, more\\n   than doubling 1994 earnings. In 1996 the company will be restructuring its\\n   businesses along geographic lines to facilitate growth of its U.S. and\\n   international operations. The company has expansion plans for its ethylene,\\n   paraxylene and polystyrene facilities in the U.S. and has international\\n   projects planned for Saudi Arabia and Singapore in 1996.\\n\\n- -  BE SELECTIVE IN NON-CORE BUSINESSES. Chevron operates four units that are\\n   outside the corporation\\'s core focus. These four units are Chevron Canada\\n   Limited (CCL) and Gulf Oil Great Britain (GOGB) whose primary operations are\\n   the refining and marketing of petroleum products in Canada and the United\\n   Kingdom, respectively; The Pittsburg & Midway Coal Mining Co. (P&M), operator\\n   of the company\\'s coal interests; and Chevron Land and Development Co. (CL&D),\\n   manager of the company\\'s surplus fee production properties and other real\\n   estate operations in California. These businesses are managed for cash flow\\n   and profitability, and for growth when attractive opportunities exist.\\n\\n   Chevron announced in March 1995 that it was exiting the real estate\\n   development business and was seeking prospective purchasers for its real\\n   estate assets in California. Bids for a significant portion of these real\\n   estate properties were received and evaluated in the third quarter of 1995.\\n   As a result, Chevron entered into exclusive negotiations with potential\\n   buyers for the sale of these properties and a $168 million provision for the\\n   estimated loss from exiting the business was recorded in the third quarter.\\n   It is anticipated that the sale of these properties will be completed in\\n   1996.\\n\\n\\n  (B) INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION\\n\\nThe company\\'s largest business is its integrated petroleum operations. Other\\noperations include chemicals and coal mining. The petroleum activities of the\\ncompany are widely distributed geographically, with major operations in the\\nUnited States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Congo, Angola, Nigeria, Papua\\nNew Guinea, Indonesia, China and Zaire. The company\\'s Caltex affiliate, through\\nits subsidiaries and affiliates, conducts exploration and production and\\ngeothermal operations in Indonesia and refining and marketing activities in the\\nEastern Hemisphere, with major operations in Japan, Korea, Australia, the\\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand and South Africa. Tengizchevroil (TCO), a 50/50\\njoint venture with a subsidiary of the national oil company of the Republic of\\nKazakstan, conducts production activities in Kazakstan, a former Soviet\\nrepublic.\\n\\nThe company\\'s chemicals operations are concentrated in the United States, but\\ninclude operating facilities in France, Japan and Brazil. The company\\'s coal\\noperations are located in the United States.\\n\\nTabulations setting forth three years\\' identifiable assets, operating income,\\nsales and other operating revenues for the company\\'s three industry segments, by\\nUnited States and International geographic areas, may be found in Note 10 to the\\nConsolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-20 of this Annual Report\\non Form 10-K.\\n\\n                                    - 5 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n  (C) DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES\\n\\nThe petroleum industry is highly competitive in the United States and throughout\\nmost of the world. This industry also competes with other industries in\\nsupplying the energy needs of various types of consumers.\\n\\nThe company\\'s operations can be affected significantly by changing economic,\\nregulatory and political environments in the various countries, including the\\nUnited States, in which it operates. The company evaluates the economic and\\npolitical risk of initiating, maintaining or expanding operations in any\\ngeographical area.\\n\\nIn the United States, environmental regulations and federal, state and local\\nactions and policies concerning economic development, energy and taxation may\\nhave a significant effect on the company\\'s operations.\\n\\nInternationally, the company continues to closely monitor the civil unrest and\\npolitical uncertainty in Angola, Nigeria and Zaire and the possible threat these\\nmay pose to the company\\'s oil and gas exploration and production operations and\\nthe safety of the company\\'s employees located in those countries.\\n\\nThe company attempts to avoid unnecessary involvement in partisan politics in\\nthe communities in which it operates but participates in the political process\\nto safeguard its assets and to ensure that the community benefits from its\\noperations and remains receptive to its continued presence.\\n\\nThe company utilizes various derivative instruments to manage its exposure to\\nprice risk stemming from its integrated petroleum activities. Some of the\\ninstruments may be settled by delivery of the underlying commodity, whereas\\nothers can only be settled in cash. All these instruments are commonly used in\\nthe global trade of petroleum products and, with the exception of certain long-\\nterm natural gas swaps, are of a short-term duration. The proposed merger of\\ncertain natural gas operations of the company with NGC Corporation will result\\nin NGC assuming most of the natural gas derivative activities.\\n\\nThe company enters into forward exchange contracts as a hedge against some of\\nits foreign currency exposures. Interest rate swaps are entered into as part of\\nthe company\\'s overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. All\\ncommodity and financial derivative instruments used by the company are\\nrelatively straightforward and involve little complexity. Their impact on the\\ncompany\\'s results of operations has not been material.\\n\\n\\n      CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES\\n\\nChevron\\'s capital and exploratory expenditures during 1995 and 1994 are\\nsummarized in the following table:\\n\\n      --------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES\\n                              (Millions of Dollars)\\n                                                     1995       1994\\n                                                   ------     ------\\n      Exploration and Production                   $2,579     $2,586\\n      Refining, Marketing and Transportation          969      1,105\\n      Chemicals                                       198        135\\n      Coal and Other Minerals                          33         44\\n      All Other                                       109        103\\n                                                   ------     ------\\n      Total Consolidated Companies                  3,888      3,973\\n      Equity in Affiliates                            912        846\\n                                                   ------     ------\\n      Total Including Affiliates                   $4,800     $4,819\\n                                                   ======     ======\\n      --------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTotal consolidated expenditures of $3.888 billion in 1995 decreased 2 percent\\nwhen compared to 1994. This reduction was the result of a drop in Refining,\\nMarketing and Transportation expenditures of $136 million due largely to the\\ncompletion in 1994 of the company\\'s program to construct new vessels that began\\nin 1989. This was\\n\\n                                    - 6 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\npartially offset by a $63 million increase in chemical expenditures, primarily\\ndue to the expansion of the linear low-density polyethylene manufacturing plant\\nat the company\\'s Cedar Bayou, Texas, chemical facility.\\n\\nConsolidated Exploration and Production (E&P) expenditures were relatively flat\\nat 66 percent and 65 percent of the company\\'s total consolidated expenditures in\\n1995 and 1994, respectively. Major international E&P expenditures in 1995\\nincluded the acquisition of additional exploration and development interests in\\nthe Republic of Congo and exploration and development activities associated with\\nthe Britannia Field in the U.K. North Sea, the North West Shelf Project in\\nAustralia, the Hibernia Project offshore Newfoundland, various waterflood and\\nsteamflood projects in Indonesia, Areas B and C in Angola and the Escravos Gas\\nProject in Nigeria. Major U.S. E&P expenditures included development projects in\\nthe Gulf of Mexico, Texas and California. Refining, marketing and transportation\\noutlays in 1995 included expenditures to upgrade the company\\'s two California\\nrefineries to produce cleaner-burning gasoline that complies with new California\\nemission regulations scheduled to be effective in mid-1996 and other projects\\nintended to upgrade and increase efficiencies at the refineries.\\n\\nThe company\\'s share of capital and exploratory expenditures by its affiliates\\nwas $912 million in 1995, an increase of 8 percent from $846 million in 1994.\\nThe company\\'s Caltex affiliate accounted for the vast majority of affiliates\\'\\nexpenditures, which were primarily comprised of ongoing refinery\\nexpansion/upgrade projects in Korea, Singapore and Japan and the construction of\\nthe new Star Petroleum refinery in Thailand, scheduled for start-up in mid-1996.\\n\\nThe company\\'s 1996 capital and exploratory expenditures, including its share of\\nequity affiliates\\' expenditures, is expected to increase 10 percent to $5.3\\nbillion. Both consolidated and affiliated expenditures are forecasted to\\nincrease by 10 percent over 1995 levels to $4.3 billion and $1 billion,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nWorldwide E&P expenditures in 1996 are expected to total $3 billion, of which\\napproximately 65 percent will be for international projects. These projects\\ninclude the continued development of the Hibernia Field, expansion of the North\\nWest Shelf Project, enhanced recovery projects in Indonesia, development of the\\nBritannia Field in the North Sea, development of the Boscan Field in Venezuela,\\ndevelopment of the N\\'Kossa and Kitina projects and delineation work at the Moho\\ndiscovery in Congo and other exploration and development projects in West\\nAfrica. In the U.S., major E&P expenditures include various development projects\\nin the Gulf of Mexico, including the deep water development of Green Canyon 205.\\n\\nWorldwide refining, marketing and transportation expenditures in 1996 are\\nestimated at $1.5 billion. After several years of major investments in the\\ncompany\\'s refineries to produce gasoline that meets federal, state and local\\nemission requirements, in 1996 the company expects to significantly reduce its\\nU.S. refining, marketing and transportation expenditures and concentrate the\\nmajority of these expenditures on marketing projects aimed at meeting consumers\\'\\nneeds and improving the company\\'s market position. International refining and\\nmarketing expenditures in 1996 include the continuation of refinery construction\\nand expansion/upgrade projects by the company\\'s Caltex affiliate to meet growing\\nproduct demand in the Pacific Rim areas, and a major program to improve retail\\nmarketing operations.\\n\\nWorldwide chemical expenditures are expected to more than double in 1996 to\\napproximately $530 million. Forecasted expenditures include the expansion and\\nmodernization of the company\\'s Port Arthur, Texas, ethylene facilities and a\\nparaxylene expansion at the company\\'s Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery.\\nInternationally, the company expects to begin the initial phases for the joint\\nventure construction of a new aromatics complex using Chevron\\'s Aromax\\ntechnology in Saudi Arabia and a fuel and lube oil additives plant in Singapore.\\n\\nThe actual expenditures for 1996 will depend on various conditions affecting the\\ncompany\\'s operations, including crude oil and natural gas prices, and may differ\\nsignificantly from the company\\'s forecast.\\n\\n\\n      PETROLEUM - EXPLORATION\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the company\\'s net interests in productive and dry\\nexploratory wells completed in each of the last three years and the number of\\nexploratory wells drilling at December 31, 1995. \"Exploratory wells\" include\\ndelineation wells, which are wells drilled to find a new reservoir in a field\\npreviously found to be productive\\n\\n                                    - 7 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nof oil or gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir beyond the\\nproved area. \"Wells drilling\" include wells temporarily suspended.\\n\\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                         EXPLORATORY WELL ACTIVITY\\n\\n                                                    NET WELLS COMPLETED(1)\\n                             WELLS DRILLING  -----------------------------------\\n                               At 12/31/95       1995        1994       1993\\n                             --------------- ----------- ----------- -----------\\n                             Gross(2) Net(2) Prod.

Chevron Petroleum Nigeria Limited (CPNL) has a\\n30 percent interest in two deepwater Niger Delta blocks and three inland Benue\\nBasin blocks and an additional sole interest in six other Benue Basin blocks.\\nCNL drilled 10 exploratory and appraisal wells in 1995, resulting in three new\\noil field discoveries, including two significant oil discoveries in the Gbodoka\\nand Dibi fields in the Benin River area. Other exploration activities in 1995\\nincluded the acquisition and interpretation of 2-D and 3-D seismic data.\\n\\nIn Angola, the company is the operator of a 2,700 square mile concession off the\\ncoast of Angola\\'s Cabinda exclave. The concession is divided into three areas:\\nArea A, which commenced production in late 1960, includes two major areas,\\nMalongo and Takula; Area B, which started production in late 1994, includes the\\nKokongo, Nemba and Lomba fields; and Area C, which is expected to start\\nproduction in early 1997, includes the N\\'Dola and Sanha fields. Chevron has a 39\\npercent interest in the concession. \"Deepwater\" Block 14, located due west of\\nAreas B and C, was awarded to Chevron (31 percent interest) and its partners in\\nFebruary 1995. Significant exploration activities in 1995 included the\\nacquisition of a 3-D seismic survey covering approximately 1,330 square miles\\nover prospective parts of Areas A, B, and C as well as Block 14 concessions. Two\\nexploratory wells were drilled in Area A in 1995, resulting in an oil discovery.\\nNegotiations were completed to renew the Exploration Extensions in Areas B and C\\nthrough February 2000. As a part of this agreement, the drilling of two\\nexploratory wells is planned for late 1997 and early 1998.

Chevron reached an agreement with\\nthe Congolese government in December 1995 to participate in the Marine IV\\nlicense, located\\n\\n                                    - 9 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\noffshore northern Congo, as operator with an 85 percent interest. If final\\napproval is granted, Chevron will conduct seismic studies in 1996.\\n\\nIn Zaire, the company has a 50 percent interest in, and is the operator of, a\\n390 square mile offshore concession. Approximately 90 square miles of 3-D\\nseismic data were acquired in the western part of the offshore Zaire concession\\nin 1995. Exploration drilling activity in 1995 consisted of one exploratory\\nwell, which resulted in a dry hole that was plugged and abandoned. The drilling\\nof three exploratory wells is planned for 1996.\\n\\nOTHER INTERNATIONAL INCLUDING AFFILIATED COMPANIES: Exploration expenditures,\\nexcluding unproved property acquisitions, were $252 million in 1995, an increase\\nof $16 million from the 1994 amount of $236 million. In addition, unproved\\nproperties of $12 million were acquired in 1995.\\n\\nIn Europe, Chevron participated in drilling six wells offshore the U.K. and\\nIreland in 1995. In addition, during the U.K.\\'s 16th licensing round, the\\ncompany was awarded two blocks in the Tertiary trend west of Shetlands, three\\nblocks in Cardigan Bay, offshore Wales and a block adjacent to Chevron\\'s Bressay\\nheavy oil discovery in the North Sea. Six blocks offshore Ireland were also\\nawarded to Chevron in 1995 in the Porcupine Basin Frontier Licensing Round.\\n\\nIn Canada, exploration efforts in 1995 continued to be concentrated in the\\nwestern part of the country near existing infrastructures that would allow any\\nreserves to be brought on production quickly. A total of 22 exploratory wells\\nwere drilled in 1995, resulting in two oil, three gas and two oil and gas\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\nIn Indonesia, Chevron\\'s interests in 12 contract areas are managed by its 50\\npercent owned P.T. Caltex Pacific Indonesia (CPI) and Amoseas Indonesia (AI)\\naffiliates. Four of five exploratory wells drilled by CPI in 1995 resulted in\\ndiscoveries that are currently being evaluated for their reserve potential. One\\nof these discoveries, Besar, was tied into existing infrastructure and placed\\ninto production in November 1995. CPI continues its exploration efforts off the\\nwest coast of Sumatra in search of natural gas for use in its enhanced oil\\nrecovery efforts and will be acquiring 2-D and 3-D seismic data to support that\\nevaluation. In 1995, the company negotiated a 100 percent interest in a new\\nproduction sharing contract in the Lariang block, covering 1,540 square miles,\\nin west-central Sulawesi that will be operated by AI on behalf of Chevron. CPI\\nhas begun negotiations for a 20 year extension of the Coastal Plains block in\\nCentral Sumatra, currently set to expire in 2001.\\n\\nIn Australia, Chevron\\'s primary interests are in two non-operated joint\\nventures, with a 16.7 percent interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Project and\\na 25.7 to 50 percent interest in permits within the West Australian Petroleum\\nPty. Ltd. (WAPET) joint venture. In addition, Chevron recently acquired a 25\\npercent interest in two Browse Basin permits and a 17.3 percent interest in one\\nCarnarvon Basin permit. NWS exploration activities in 1995 included the drilling\\nof the Perseus-1 well between the North Rankin and Goodwyn fields, which\\nresulted in a major gas discovery and the Sculptor-1 well, which added gas and\\ncondensate reserves to the Echo/Yodel fields. Interpretation of the East Dampier\\n3-D seismic survey continued in 1995 and exploration drilling in several\\nprospects is planned for mid-1996. WAPET\\'s Chrysaor-1 well was confirmed as a\\nsignificant gas discovery after tests were performed in early 1995. A 3-D\\nseismic survey was also shot over the Chrysaor structure in 1995.\\n\\nIn Papua New Guinea, Chevron and its partners drilled three exploratory wells in\\nthe PPL-161 license. One well near the Kutubu facilities recovered oil. Further\\nevaluation of this well will continue into early 1996.\\n\\nIn China, Chevron was awarded sole interest in a production-sharing contract in\\nBlock 62/23 and a geophysical agreement in Block 50/20, both south of Hainan\\nIsland in the South China Sea. Seismic data was acquired for both blocks and one\\nwell is planned for 1996. Exploration drilling in East China Sea Block 33/08\\nresulted in two dry holes and no further activity is planned. The company also\\nsubmitted bids for acreage in Liaodong Bay, offshore northeast China, and South\\nChina Sea Block 63/15 in 1995.\\n\\nOther areas where exploration activities occurred in 1995 include Bolivia where\\nthe company acquired seismic data over some prospects in the southern half of\\nthe Caipipendi Exploration Block, Colombia where evaluation of the Rio Blanco\\nExploration Block continued in 1995 with the drilling of an exploratory well,\\nand Peru where the\\n\\n                                    - 10 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\ncompany obtained a 100 percent interest in exploration block 52, which is\\nadjacent to the Camisea gas-condensate field.\\n\\n\\n      PETROLEUM - OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the company\\'s and its affiliates\\' 1995 net\\nproduction of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas.\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n           1995 Net Production* Of Crude Oil And Natural Gas Liquids\\n                                And Natural Gas\\n\\n                                        Crude Oil &            Natural Gas\\n                                     Natural Gas Liquids      (thousands of\\n                                      (barrels per day)     cubic feet per day)\\n                                     -------------------    -------------------\\n    United States\\n        -California                        119,870                 125,410\\n        -Gulf of Mexico                    112,480                 923,750\\n        -Texas                              65,670                 411,520\\n        -Colorado                           13,470                       -\\n        -Wyoming                             9,260                 145,300\\n        -New Mexico                          8,240                 101,990\\n        -Louisiana                           4,590                  50,030\\n        -Other States                       15,800                 109,950\\n                                         ---------               ---------\\n    Total United States                    349,380               1,867,950\\n                                         ---------               ---------\\n    Africa                                 261,220                       -\\n    United Kingdom (North Sea)              71,160                  28,210\\n    Canada                                  48,290                 242,560\\n    Australia                               25,100                 208,430\\n    Papua New Guinea                        23,620                       -\\n    Indonesia                               22,620                     590\\n    China                                    9,040                       -\\n    Other International                     10,290                   3,460\\n                                         ---------               ---------\\n    Total International                    471,340                 483,250\\n                                         ---------               ---------\\n    Total Consolidated Companies           820,720               2,351,200\\n\\n    Equity in Affiliates                   179,990                  81,600\\n                                         ---------               ---------\\n    Total Including Affiliates           1,000,710               2,432,800\\n                                         =========               =========\\n\\n    * Net production excludes royalty interest owned by others.\\n\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPRODUCTION LEVELS:\\n\\nIn 1995, net crude oil and natural gas liquids production, including affiliates,\\nincreased for the third year in a row, rising from 992,510 barrels per day in\\n1994 to 1,000,710 barrels per day in 1995. The increase was due to higher\\nproduction in Africa, primarily in Angola where the Kokongo Field began\\nproducing in late 1994 and Australia, where the Goodwyn development began\\nproduction in early 1995. These production increases were partially offset by\\nproduction declines in the United States due primarily to normal field declines.\\n\\nNet production of natural gas, including affiliates, decreased 8 percent from\\n2,630,570 thousand cubic feet per day in 1994 to 2,432,800 thousand cubic feet\\nper day in 1995.

Additions to\\nproved reserves during 1995 from extensions, discoveries and improved recovery,\\nbefore revisions, were 94 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids\\nand 616 billion cubic feet of natural gas.\\n\\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, significant development activities in 1995 included the\\nevaluation of alternative development concepts for the Green Canyon 205 Field\\nlocated in 2,600 feet of water. The project execution plan calls for initial\\nproduction in 1998, with peak production expected to reach 55,000 barrels per\\nday and 72 million cubic feet of gas per day. Eleven wells drilled in the Eugene\\nIsland 238 Field were successful, resulting in seven gas and four oil\\ndiscoveries. Three wells in the South Marsh Island 66 Field were drilled in\\n1995, with all three resulting in either a gas or oil discovery. In the Norphlet\\ntrend, which stretches some 80 miles from the Destin Dome area (offshore\\nFlorida) to the Mobile Block 861 area (offshore Mississippi), production from\\nthree wells in the Mobile Block 916 Area offshore Alabama commenced in April\\n1995. Chevron\\'s percentage interests in these fields vary from 33 to 100 percent\\n\\nOffshore California, Chevron owns approximately 25 percent of the Point Arguello\\nproject and operates two offshore platforms (Hermosa and Hidalgo), the onshore \\nGaviota oil and gas plant and the interconnecting pipelines. Production from the\\nproject averaged 59,000 barrels of oil per day in 1995, down from 78,000 in\\n1994. In addition, the percentage of water produced approximately doubled\\nbetween periods. Chevron\\'s share of proved oil and gas reserves declined by 31\\npercent in 1995 due to production and reserve revisions, partially offset by\\nreserve additions resulting from two redrills on the Hermosa platform. The\\ncompany and its partners are currently reviewing options to address these\\nissues. About two-thirds of current production is delivered via pipeline to\\nvarious California locations. However, due to a shortage of adequate\\ntransportation facilities to Los Angeles, the balance of production is shipped\\nvia pipeline to markets in Texas, resulting in increased transportation costs.\\nPartners in the Pacific Pipeline Project, in which Chevron has a minority\\ninterest, continue to work on the development of a 130-mile pipeline that would\\ncarry Point Arguello oil production to Los Angeles refineries.\\n\\n                                    - 13 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nOther development projects in the U.S. included the employment of enhanced\\nrecovery methods using steam and water to increase both the production rate and\\nthe amount of oil ultimately recoverable from fields in California\\'s San Joaquin\\nValley, the drilling of 56 new wells in the Laredo and Terrell County areas of\\nTexas, which increased proved gas reserves by a combined 114 billion cubic feet,\\nand the signing of an agreement with the Osage Tribe and Davis Brothers Oil\\nProducers to begin 3-D seismic evaluation of more than 400,000 acres of tribal\\nland in Osage County, Oklahoma.\\n\\nAFRICA: Developmental expenditures in Africa were $640 million in 1995, compared\\nto $276 million in 1994. The increase was primarily due to higher expenditures\\nin Congo, Nigeria and Angola, with Congo expenditures accounting for\\napproximately 55 percent of the increase. Expenditures for proved reserve\\nacquisitions amounted to $56 million in 1995. Additions to proved reserves from\\nextensions, discoveries and improved recovery, before revisions, were 173\\nmillion barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 22 billion cubic feet\\nof natural gas.\\n\\nIn Nigeria, total production from 29 CNL-operated fields averaged 384,000\\nbarrels of oil per day, an increase of about 15,000 barrels per day from 1994.\\nThis increase was primarily due to the addition of three fields, Mejo, Ojumole\\nand Omuro, that were put into production in 1995. Production from non-operated\\nfields averaged approximately 54,000 barrels of oil per day in 1995. On-site\\nconstruction for the Escravos Gas Project began in May 1995. Fabrication of the\\nfloating storage and offloading vessel, the offshore compression platform, and\\nthe onshore LPG extraction plant will continue in 1996. The project is expected\\nto start-up in mid-1997 and will utilize gas currently being flared from the\\nOkan and Mefa fields.\\n\\nIn Angola, fifteen development wells were drilled in Area A fields during 1995.\\nFive were in the Malongo Area and ten were in the Takula Area. The company\\nexpects that the combination of exploratory discoveries, infill drilling,\\nworkovers and facility modernization should maintain production from Area A in\\nthe near future. Areas B and C continue to be the primary focus of major\\ndevelopment activities, which included work on an early production system in the\\nNemba Field that commenced production in January 1996.\\n\\nIn Congo, seven development wells have been drilled in the Kitina Field to date,\\nwith further development drilling to continue in 1996. A platform, tied via\\npipeline to processing and export facilities at the onshore Djeno terminal, is\\nplanned for late 1997, with first oil in early 1998. Appraisal drilling at the\\nKitina South structure in 1995 confirmed the existence of a separate oil pool.\\nAt the N\\'Kossa Field, 14 wells have been drilled to date and two platforms were\\ninstalled that will allow a second phase of development drilling to continue\\nthrough 1996. First oil is planned for mid-1996 and the field is expected to\\nreach peak production of 110,000 barrels per day in late 1997.\\n\\nIn Zaire, four development wells, two water injection wells and one workover\\nwere completed in 1995. In 1996, the Tshiala Field development will continue\\nwith four wells planned. To date, 78 exploratory and development wells have been\\ndrilled and forty-one are currently on stream. Crude oil production from eight\\noffshore fields averaged 19,600 barrels per day in 1995.\\n\\nOTHER INTERNATIONAL INCLUDING AFFILIATED COMPANIES: Development expenditures in\\n1995 were $672 million compared to $816 million in 1994. The decrease was\\nlargely due to lower expenditures by the company\\'s Tengizchevroil affiliate.\\nAdditions to proved reserves from extensions, discoveries and improved\\nrecoveries were 122 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 204\\nbillion cubic feet of natural gas.\\n\\nIn Europe, the company has interests in over 60 blocks in the U.K. and Ireland,\\nwhich total approximately 2.4 million gross acres, including six producing\\nfields in the North Sea where the company\\'s interest varies from 4.8 to 33.3\\npercent. The company also has interests to the west of Shetlands, offshore Wales\\nand in Liverpool Bay. Offshore Ireland, Chevron has acreage in the Celtic Sea\\nand the Porcupine Basin. The company\\'s share of production from these fields\\naveraged 71,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 28 million\\ncubic feet of gas per day in 1995. Production from Phase I of the North Sea\\'s\\nAlba Field, in which Chevron has a 33.2 percent interest, averaged 69,100\\nbarrels of oil per day in 1995. Modifications to four of the platform\\'s well\\nslots, allowing the well slots to house two rather than one well, has eliminated\\nthe need for a stand alone second platform during Phase II of the project to\\ndevelop the southern area of the reservoir. Phase II development commenced in\\nNovember 1995 when the first of eighteen development wells was spudded from the\\nAlba Northern platform into the southern area of the reservoir. Detailed design\\nengineering was started on a $46 million oil capacity upgrade, from 75,000 to\\n\\n                                    - 14 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nover 100,000 barrels per day, for the Alba Northern platform, in anticipation of\\nadded production from Phase II. The Britannia gas field development in the North\\nSea, which lies underneath the Alba Field 130 miles northeast of Aberdeen,\\nproceeded with the drilling of nine pre-development wells and the start of \\nfabrication of the steel jacket and topsides. Peak production is expected to be\\napproximately 740 million cubic feet of gas and 70,000 barrels of condensate per\\nday with initial production expected to commence in late 1998.\\n\\nIn Canada, the company continues to concentrate its development efforts in six\\ncore producing areas in Alberta and one in Manitoba where operating efficiencies\\nand lower operating costs can be realized using existing infrastructure. The\\ncompany drilled 26 wells that were targeted at new reserves around existing\\ninfrastructures along with 87 development wells in existing fields. The Hibernia\\nDevelopment project, in which Chevron has a 26.9 percent interest, proceeded on\\nschedule in 1995. The five main topsides have been interconnected. Plans for\\nmating the topsides to the Gravity Base Structure on which they will sit and the\\ntowout from its fabrication site at Bull Arm, Newfoundland to the Hibernia\\nField, 200 miles offshore Newfoundland, in mid-1997 are under way. Oil\\nproduction is expected to begin in late 1997 or early 1998. The company\\'s\\ncapitalized investment in this project was $806 million at year-end 1995. The\\ncompany streamlined its Canadian oil and gas subsidiary, Chevron Canada\\nResources, by reducing its business unit structure from eight to five and\\nreducing its workforce by 20%, or 200 employees.\\n\\nIn Indonesia, the Duri Steamflood Project, begun in 1985 to assist the difficult\\nproduction process for the relatively heavy, waxy Duri crude, is being completed\\nin 13 stages (Areas 1-13) with seven areas currently on production. The field\\nhas two billion barrels of recoverable oil, with total production averaging over\\n300,000 barrels per day in 1995. A waterflood project involving 21 fields in\\nCentral Sumatra continued in 1995 as water injection at the Minas Field moved\\ninto phase three of a four phase pattern waterflood project that started in\\nDecember 1993. Expansion of the waterflood efforts in 1995 included the start-up\\nof a new project in the Beruk Field and government approval for a similar\\nproject in the Bekasap Field. Delivery of steam from the Darajat I plant in the\\nDarajat geothermal field, located 115 miles southeast of Jakarta, continued at a\\nsteady pace in 1995. Government approval for the Darajat II plant, for which AI\\nhas acquired an Indonesian partner, was received in January 1996. The 70\\nmegawatt plant is expected to be operational in late 1998.\\n\\nIn Kazakstan, Tengizchevroil increased its production capacity to 95,000 barrels\\na day at the end of 1994 with the completion of a second processing plant.\\nHowever, during most of 1995 production was constrained by the lack of\\nsufficient export capability and averaged only 58,000 barrels per day in 1995,\\nup from 46,000 barrels per day in 1994. The pace of further field development is\\ndependent on the availability of additional export capacity or the securing of\\nother marketing alternatives. The partners remain committed to realizing the\\nfull potential of the project and continue to explore alternatives and\\nopportunities for the export of Tengiz crude oil.\\n\\nIn Australia, production from the Goodwyn Field, which is being developed as\\npart of the North West Shelf (NWS) Project, came on stream in February 1995 and\\nreached 70,000 barrels per day of condensate and 400 million cubic feet of gas\\nper day by year end. Development drilling will continue in 1996. The\\nWanaea/Cossack development also came on stream in November 1995 and reached peak\\nproduction of 115,000 barrels of oil per day shortly thereafter. WAPET\\ndevelopment activities included the start of a 20 well infill drilling program\\non Barrow Island in November 1995 and evaluation of alternatives for the\\ndevelopment of the Gorgon Field\\'s gas reserves as either a stand-alone project\\nor as a co-operative expansion of the existing NWS liquefied natural gas (LNG)\\nproject.\\n\\nIn Papua New Guinea, Chevron (19 percent interest) and its partners completed\\nengineering work on the Gobe fields in the southeastern portion of the PPL-161\\nlicense in anticipation of the submission of a Petroleum Development License\\napplication to the Papua New Guinea government in early 1996. Evaluations for\\nthe development of gas discoveries in the PPL-101 license (P\\'nyang and Juha gas\\nfields) and the PDL-2 license (Hedinia field gas cap) are continuing. An active\\ndevelopment drilling program designed to accelerate production and develop new\\nreserves for the Kutubu Area fields continued in 1995 and has allowed production\\nfrom these fields to remain at a rate in excess of 100,000 barrels of oil per\\nday throughout  the year.\\n\\nIn China, work to develop the HZ/32-2 and HZ/32-3 fields concluded in June 1995,\\nbringing the total number of producing fields in the 16/08 contract area of the\\nPearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea to four. Total output at year end\\n1995 from these four fields was 120,000 barrels of oil per day with Chevron\\'s\\nshare at 16.33 percent. The first stage of an enhanced oil recovery pilot\\nproject using Chevron\\'s Microbial Profile Modification\\n\\n                                    - 15 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\ntechnology was completed at Daqing, China\\'s largest oil field, with the\\ncompletion of the pilot area wells. The next stage, involving microbe injection\\nin these wells, will occur in 1996.\\n\\nIn Venezuela, Chevron and Maraven S.A. formed an alliance in late 1995 to\\nfurther develop the Boscan oil field. In mid-1996, Chevron will become\\nresponsible for the operations and production of this field under a fee\\narrangement, whereby Chevron will be compensated on the basis of barrels\\nproduced. Boscan production is currently about 80,000 barrels per day. In\\naddition, the alliance calls for the supply of Venezuelan crude oil to Chevron\\nrefineries in the U.S. and a Chevron/Maraven partnership that will market\\nasphalt and other related products in the western U.S.\\n\\n\\n      PETROLEUM - NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS\\n\\nChevron\\'s wholly owned Warren Petroleum Company is engaged in all phases of the\\nU.S. natural gas liquids (NGL\\'s) business and is the largest U.S. wholesale\\nmarketer of NGL\\'s, selling to customers in 46 states.\\n\\nWarren\\'s business encompasses: 1) extraction, which includes 15 processing\\nplants with a total processing capacity of 3.3 billion cubic feet of gas per day\\nand equity interests in an additional 14 plants, 2) fractionation, which\\nincludes a 220,000 barrel per day capacity fractionation plant at Mont Belvieu,\\nTexas and 3) distribution, which includes the Warrengas Terminal, located on the\\nHouston Ship Channel and linked to the Mont Belvieu complex by dedicated\\npipelines.

In 1995, Caltex\\nmerged its Australian refining and marketing assets with those of Ampol Limited,\\nacquiring a 37.5 percent equity interest in a refinery in Brisbane, Australia\\nand reducing its interest in a Sydney, Australia refinery from 75 percent to\\n37.5 percent. In December 1995 Caltex announced that it is selling its 50\\npercent interest in Nippon Petroleum Refining Company, Limited, which includes\\ntwo refineries in Japan, to its partner, Nippon Oil Company, Limited. The\\ncompany\\'s share of refining capacity for these two refineries totaled 255\\nthousand barrels per day at year end 1995.\\n\\nDistillation operating capacity utilization in 1995 averaged 82 percent in the\\nUnited States and 85 percent worldwide (including affiliate), compared with 93\\npercent in the United States and 94 percent worldwide in 1994. Chevron\\'s\\ncapacity utilization of its U.S. cracking and coking facilities, which are the\\nprimary facilities used to convert heavier products to gasoline and other light\\nproducts, averaged 79 percent in 1995, down from 90 percent in 1994. The company\\nimports crude oil for its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted\\nfor almost half of U.S. refinery inputs in 1995.\\n\\nIn 1995, the company concluded work on various expansion/upgrade projects at its\\nRichmond and El Segundo, California, refineries. Over the past few years,\\napproximately $700 million was spent at each refinery on projects aimed at\\nmeeting regional clean air requirements and to produce cleaner-burning motor\\ngasoline and diesel fuel as required by the California Air Resources Board and\\nthe Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. These projects also included the\\nupgrading of key processing units to improve yields of high value light\\nproducts, and to improve their reliability and cost efficiency.\\n\\nAt the Milford Haven, Wales refinery, a $27 million upgrade project to comply\\nwith legislation on gasoil sulfur is scheduled to be completed by the end of May\\n1996, with the objective of supplying low sulfur diesel fuel by August.\\n\\nCaltex and its partner completed construction of a 130,000 barrels-per-day\\ngrassroots refinery in Map Ta Phut in March 1996, with full production\\ncommencing in mid-1996. At the Yocheon refinery in South Korea, construction of\\na new crude unit and hydrotreater that will increase production of gasoline and\\nlow-sulfur diesel fuel is continuing. The anticipated start-up date of these new\\nunits is late 1996. At the Singapore export refinery, a major expansion/upgrade\\nproject was completed in 1995.

Worldwide sales volumes,\\nincluding the company\\'s share of affiliate\\'s sales, averaged 2,086 thousand\\nbarrels per day in 1995, a decrease of about 7 percent from 1994. This decrease\\nwas largely due to the sale of the company\\'s Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,\\nrefinery in August 1994 and its Port Arthur, Texas refinery in February 1995 as\\nwell as refinery downtime in 1995.

This automated system allows credit\\ncard customers to pay at the pump with credit approvals processed in about five\\nseconds using satellite data transmission.\\n\\nIn December 1995, the company announced the realignment of its U.S. gasoline\\nmarketing business, combining several regional offices and consolidating support\\nfunctions with the aim of increasing the focus of the organization on customer\\nservice and sales growth. The reorganization will leave service station\\noperations largely unaffected, but will reduce the number of non-service station\\nsupport personnel by 130 positions.\\n\\nInternationally, the company\\'s branded products are sold in 193 owned or leased\\nstations in British Columbia, Canada and in 523 (208 owned or leased) stations\\nin the United Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n      PETROLEUM - TRANSPORTATION\\n\\nTANKERS: Chevron\\'s controlled seagoing fleet at December 31, 1995 is summarized\\nin the following table.

The former Olefins and Aromatics\\ndivisions will be combined to form one U.S. Chemicals Division that will be\\nheadquartered in Houston, Texas. A new International Group, headquartered in San\\nRamon, California, will be responsible for coordination of non-U.S. supply\\nsources, marketing, and new manufacturing projects overseas. The Oronite\\nAdditives Division, which already operates internationally, is unaffected by the\\nreorganization.\\n\\nExpansion of the linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) manufacturing facility\\nat Cedar Bayou, Texas was completed in the first quarter of 1996. The expansion\\nincreased the plant\\'s production capacity of LLDPE by 340 million pounds per\\nyear. The company announced plans to expand and modernize its ethylene\\nproduction facilities at Port Arthur, Texas. The project, expected to begin in\\n1996 and last through year-end 1997, will increase plant capacity from 1 billion\\nto 1.7 billion pounds per year. The company\\'s Marietta, Ohio polystyrene plant\\nis also slated for a $50 million expansion, which is targeted for an April 1997\\nstart-up. At the company\\'s Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery, construction on a\\nparaxylene facility expansion is scheduled to begin in 1996, with an anticipated\\nstart-up date in 1998. Internationally, in a 50/50 joint venture, the company\\nexpects to begin construction of a $600 million aromatics complex using the\\ncompany\\'s Aromax technology in Jubail, Saudi Arabia in 1996. The company has\\nalso contracted to build a fuel and lube oil additives plant in Singapore.\\n\\n\\n      COAL AND OTHER MINERALS\\n\\nCOAL: The company\\'s wholly-owned coal mining and marketing subsidiary, The\\nPittsburg and Midway Coal Mining Co. (P&M), owned and operated three surface and\\ntwo underground mines as of year-end 1995. Two of the mines are located in New\\nMexico and one each in Wyoming, Alabama and Kentucky. All of the mines produce\\nsteam coal used primarily for electric power generation. P&M\\'s strategy is to\\nfocus on regional markets in the United States, capitalizing on major utility\\ngrowth markets in the southwest and southeast. P&M also has a 33 percent\\ninterest in the Black Beauty Coal Company whose principal operations are in\\nIndiana and Illinois.\\n\\nSales of coal from P&M\\'s wholly-owned mines and from its interest in the Black\\nBeauty Coal Company were 17.3 million tons in 1995, a decrease of 15 percent\\nfrom 1994 sales of 20.4 million tons. The decrease was primarily due to lower\\nsales at the McKinley, New Mexico mine (caused by an abundance of hydroelectric\\npower and high customer coal inventories that led to reduced demand), a\\nreduction in the company\\'s interest in Black Beauty Coal Company from 50 percent\\nto 33 percent in late August 1994 and reduced sales from the Edna, Colorado coal\\nmine that was idled in December 1994. About 60 percent of 1995 sales came from\\ntwo mines, the McKinley Mine and the\\n\\n                                    - 22 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nKemmerer Mine in Wyoming. The average selling price for coal from mines owned\\nand operated by P&M was $23.67 per ton in 1995 compared to $24.39 per ton in\\n1994, contributing $350 million and $414 million to Chevron\\'s consolidated sales\\nand other operating revenues in 1995 and 1994, respectively. At year-end 1995,\\nP&M controlled approximately 507 million tons of developed and undeveloped coal\\nreserves, including significant reserves of environmentally desirable low-sulfur\\ncoal.\\n\\nDemand growth for coal in the United States remains largely dependent on the\\ndemand for electric power, which in turn depends on regional and national\\neconomic conditions and on competition from other fuel sources. In 1995, the\\nelectric utility industry consumed over 80 percent of all coal produced in the\\nUnited States. Approximately 88 percent of P&M\\'s coal sales are made to electric\\nutilities. Of those sales, about 50 percent are under contracts longer than 10\\nyears and 20 percent are under three to ten year contracts based on original\\ncontract terms. Generally, these contracts contain index adjusted pricing\\nprovisions and minimum take requirements that have helped mitigate the effects\\nof short-term fluctuations in coal prices and consumption levels on P&M.\\n\\n\\n      RESEARCH AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\\n\\nRESEARCH: The company\\'s principal research laboratories are at Richmond and La\\nHabra, California. The Richmond facility engages in research on new and improved\\nrefinery processes, develops petroleum and chemical products, and provides\\ntechnical services for the company and its customers. The La Habra facility\\nconducts research and provides technical support in geology, geophysics and\\nother exploration science, as well as oil production methods such as hydraulics,\\nassisted recovery programs and drilling, including offshore drilling. Employees\\nin subsidiaries engaged primarily in research activities at year-end 1995\\nnumbered approximately 2,300.\\n\\nChevron\\'s research and development expenses were $185 million, $179 million and\\n$206 million for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.\\n\\nIn August 1995 the company agreed to license its Isodewaxing technology to\\nChina\\'s Daqing Petroleum Administrative Bureau for a planned lube base oil plant\\n750 miles northeast of Bejing. The company\\'s Isodewaxing technology also was\\nselected by Neste Oy for a new lube oil manufacturing facility at Porvoo\\nRefinery near Helsinki, Finland. Isodewaxing is a catalytic process that\\nchanges the characteristics of waxy molecules in crude feedstocks, resulting in\\na greater yield of high-quality base oils at a lower operating cost than\\nconventional solvent-based processing.\\n\\nLicenses under the company\\'s patents are generally made available to others in\\nthe petroleum and chemical industries. However, the company\\'s business is not\\ndependent upon licensing patents.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: One of Chevron\\'s goals is to be recognized worldwide\\nfor environmental excellence. Chevron\\'s revised corporate policy on Health,\\nEnvironment and Safety was approved by the stockholders in 1991. In 1992, a\\ncomprehensive program of 102 management practices was approved by senior\\nmanagement to strengthen the implementation of the policy. The program is called\\n\"Protecting People and the Environment\" and is modeled after the Chemical\\nManufacturers Association\\'s program called \"Responsible Care.\" It is also\\nsimilar to the American Petroleum Institute\\'s program called \"Strategies for\\nToday\\'s Environmental Partnership.\" In 1994, the company published an\\nenvironmental, health and safety performance report named \"Measuring Progress -\\nA Report on Chevron\\'s Environmental Performance.\" This report describes the\\ncompany\\'s environmental performance since its last environmental report issued\\nin 1990 and summarizes the company\\'s policy and approach to environmental\\nprotection.\\n\\nThe company\\'s oil and gas exploration activities, along with those of many other\\npetroleum companies, have been hampered by drilling moratoria, imposed because\\nof environmental concerns, in areas where the company has leasehold interests.\\nDifficulties and delays in obtaining necessary permits, such as those\\nexperienced by Chevron and its partners in the Point Arguello Field offshore\\nCalifornia, can delay or restrict oil and gas development projects. While events\\nsuch as these can impact current and future earnings, either directly or through\\nlost opportunities, the company does not believe they will have a material\\neffect on the company\\'s consolidated financial\\n\\n                                    - 23 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nposition, its liquidity, or its competitive position relative to other U.S. or\\ninternational petroleum concerns. The situation has, however, been a factor,\\namong others, in the shift of the company\\'s exploration efforts to areas outside\\nof the United States.\\n\\nSince 1991, the company has spent over $1.6 billion in capital expenditures on\\nair quality projects at its refining facilities, primarily in order to comply\\nwith federal and state clean air regulations and to provide consumers with fuels\\nthat reduce air pollution and air toxicity. As of January 1, 1995, the Clean Air\\nAct Amendments of 1990 require that only reformulated gasoline (RFG) may be sold\\nin the nine worst ozone areas in the United States and other areas have\\nvoluntarily opted into the RFG requirement. In addition, the California Air\\nResources Board requires a more stringent reformulated gasoline be sold\\nstatewide in all service stations beginning on June 1, 1996.\\n\\nThe Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) created federal authority to direct\\nprivate responses to oil spills, to improve preparedness and response\\ncapabilities, and to impose monetary damages on spillers for restoration and\\nloss of use of the resources during restoration. Under OPA, owners or operators\\nof vessels operating in U.S. waters or transferring cargo in waters within the\\nU.S. Exclusive Economic Zone are required to possess a Certificate of Financial\\nResponsibility for each of these vessels. The Certificate is issued by the U.S.\\nCoast Guard after the owner or operator has demonstrated the ability to meet\\nCoast Guard guidelines for financial responsibility in the case of an oil spill.\\nOPA also requires the scheduled phase-out, by year-end 2014, of all single hull\\ntankers for trading to U.S. ports or transferring cargo in waters within the\\nU.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, which has and will continue to result in the\\nutilization of more costly double hull tankers. A separate single hull phase-out\\nschedule under the International Maritime Organization\\'s Regulation 13 is\\nleading to the utilization of more costly double hull tankers in Europe and some\\nother parts of the world. Chevron has been actively involved in the Marine\\nPreservation Association, a non-profit organization that funds the Marine Spill\\nResponse Corporation (MSRC). MSRC owns the largest stockpile of oil spill\\nresponse equipment in the nation and operates five strategically located U.S.\\ncoastal regional centers. In addition, the company is a member of many oil-spill\\nresponse cooperatives in areas in which it operates around the world.\\n\\nThe company expects the enactment of additional federal and state regulations\\naddressing the issue of waste management and disposal and effluent emission\\nlimitations for offshore oil and gas operations. While the costs of operating in\\nan environmentally responsible manner and complying with existing and\\nanticipated environmental legislation and regulations, including loss\\ncontingencies for prior operations, are expected to be significant, the company\\nanticipates that these costs will not have a material impact on its consolidated\\nfinancial position, its liquidity, or its competitive position in the industry.\\n\\nIn 1995, the company\\'s U.S. capitalized environmental expenditures were $607\\nmillion, representing approximately 29 percent of the company\\'s total\\nconsolidated U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures. The company\\'s U.S.\\ncapitalized environmental expenditures were $645 million and $620 million in\\n1994 and 1993, respectively. These environmental expenditures include capital\\noutlays to retrofit existing facilities, as well as those associated with new\\nfacilities. The expenditures are predominantly in the petroleum segment and\\nrelate mostly to air and water quality projects and activities at the company\\'s\\nrefineries, oil and gas producing facilities and marketing facilities. For 1996,\\nthe company estimates that capital expenditures for environmental control\\nfacilities will be approximately $188 million. The actual expenditures for 1996\\nwill depend on various conditions affecting the company\\'s operations and may\\ndiffer significantly from the company\\'s forecast. The company is committed to\\nprotecting the environment wherever it operates, including strict compliance\\nwith all governmental regulations. The future annual capital costs of fulfilling\\nthis commitment are uncertain, but are expected to stabilize at the estimated\\n1996 levels with the completion of air quality projects in 1995 to produce\\ncleaner-burning fuels at the company\\'s two California refineries.\\n\\nUnder provisions of the Superfund law, Chevron has been designated as a\\npotentially responsible party (PRP) for remediation of a portion of 251\\nhazardous waste sites. Since remediation costs will vary from site to site as\\nwell as the company\\'s share of responsibility for each site, the number of sites\\nin which the company has been identified as a PRP should not be used as a\\nrelevant measure of total liability. At year-end 1995, the company\\'s\\nenvironmental remediation reserve related to Superfund sites amounted to $60\\nmillion. Forecasted expenditures for the largest of these sites, located in\\nCalifornia, amounts to approximately 18 percent of the reserve.\\n\\n                                    - 24 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nThe company\\'s 1995 environmental expenditures, remediation provisions and year-\\nend environmental reserves are discussed on pages FS-2 through FS-3 of this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\n\\nA.  CITIES SERVICE TENDER OFFER CASES.\\nThe complaint by Cities Service Co. (\"Cities Service\") and two individual\\nplaintiffs was originally filed in August 1982 in Oklahoma state court in Tulsa.\\nPrior proceedings have effectively eliminated the two individual plaintiffs as\\nparties. The defendants were initially Gulf Oil Corporation and GOC Acquisition\\nCorporation. Subsequent filings have identified Chevron U.S.A. Inc. as the\\nsuccessor in interest to Gulf Oil Corporation. In the original complaint Cities\\nService pleaded for damages of not less than $2.7 billion together with legal\\ninterest for breach of contract and misrepresentation. The great bulk of the\\ndamages were related to claims on behalf of shareholders of Cities Service. All\\nof the claims by Cities Service shareholders have been dismissed.\\n\\nPlaintiff Cities Service filed its Second Amended Petition on April 25, 1994,\\nadding Oxy U.S.A. as the successor to plaintiff Cities Service, adding Chevron\\nU.S.A. Inc. as successor to Gulf Oil Corporation and adding Chevron Corporation\\nas a new defendant. In addition to the existing claims for breach of contract\\nand fraud, the amendments added the following causes of action: willful and\\nmalicious breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, interference with\\nprospective economic advantage in connection with the 1989 proposed Oxy-Cities\\nDepartment of Energy (\"DOE\") settlement, and the claimed DOE liability as\\nadditional contract damages and as additional fraud damages. The amendment also\\nadded a claim for punitive damages based upon the alleged fraud, negligent\\nmisrepresentation, willful breach and interference claims and requested not less\\nthan $100 million on each of the several claims, together with pre-judgment\\ninterest and punitive damages. It also requested $12 million plus prejudgment\\ninterest for Cities\\' costs in defending against DOE proceedings since 1989, and\\nan order entitling Cities Service to recover such \"restitutionary obligation\"\\namounts ultimately paid by Oxy U.S.A. to the DOE in excess of its proposed 1989\\nDOE settlement, and punitive damages.\\n\\nDefendants answered, in part, the plaintiff\\'s Second Amended Petition and moved\\nto dismiss the claims for negligent misrepresentation, malicious breach of\\ncontract and interference with prospective economic advantage. In addition,\\ndefendant Chevron Corporation moved to dismiss the petition for lack of subject\\nmatter jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe motion to dismiss the new tort claim and certain other claims was denied and\\nan answer to these claims was timely filed. Chevron Corporation\\'s motion to\\ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was granted on September 7, 1994.\\nPlaintiff\\'s motion to dismiss defendants\\' counterclaim was also granted.\\n\\nThe Oklahoma Supreme Court has denied defendants\\' petition for certiorari on the\\ntrial court\\'s certified interlocutory order concerning the defenses based upon\\ncertain conditions in the contract and alleged misstatements by plaintiff\\nconcerning its potential DOE liability.\\n\\n                                    - 25 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nPlaintiff\\'s motion to bifurcate this case for two trials was granted by the\\ntrial court on January 23, 1995. The first, and now only, trial will concern\\nplaintiff\\'s claims for alleged breach of contract, willful and malicious breach\\nof contract, and negligent misrepresentation. Jury selection is expected to\\nbegin in late March 1996. The second trial was to have covered plaintiff\\'s\\nclaims for alleged interference with prospective economic advantage in\\nconnection with the proposed 1989 DOE settlement, and the claimed DOE liability\\nas additional damages under another claim of breach of contract. These claims\\nwere settled in November 1995.\\n\\nB.  PERTH AMBOY NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARD PENALTY.\\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claims that Chevron\\'s\\nPerth Amboy refinery violated various provisions of the Clean Air Act New Source\\nPerformance Standards (\"NSPS\") as a result of refinery modifications conducted\\nin 1973 and 1983. The EPA issued a compliance order in November 1993 and in 1994\\nissued a formal determination that the NSPS applied to the refinery. Chevron\\npaid a penalty of approximately $700,000 to settle the matter.\\n\\nC.  PREMANUFACTURE NOTIFICATION FOR DETERGENT ADDITIVES.\\nOn September 30,1993, the EPA instituted an administrative proceeding, assessing\\ncivil penalties of about $17 million for alleged violations of the Toxic\\nSubstances Control Act (TSCA). The EPA contends that the company was required to\\nfile Premanufacture Notifications (PMNs) with regard to six chemical substances\\nmanufactured or imported since 1990. The company believes that no PMNs were\\nrequired because the chemicals were within the scope of existing TSCA inventory\\nlistings. Nevertheless, the company reported the situation to the EPA when it\\nwas advised by a third party that the EPA may, without public notice, have\\nrevised its interpretation of TSCA regulations to require PMNs to be filed in\\nsuch circumstances. Thereafter, under protest, the company suspended the\\nproduction and importation of the chemicals and filed PMNs for them, continuing\\nthe suspension for the 90-day period contemplated by TSCA. The detergents in\\nquestion are very similar to common detergents and intermediates used in their\\nproduction, and the EPA does not appear to claim that failure to file a PMN\\nresulted in any health or safety risk. The EPA permitted the company to dispose\\nof its current stocks of the chemicals during the period that the company\\nsuspended their production and importation. The company has challenged the\\npenalty assessment through an administrative appeal.\\n\\nD.  EL SEGUNDO REFINERY REFORMULATED GASOLINE PROJECT.\\nOn September 22, 1993, the EPA instituted an administrative proceeding\\ncontending that the company had not received a permit required under the Clean\\nAir Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) for field activities at the El Segundo\\nrefinery relating to the production of reformulated gasolines, which was\\nfederally mandated by January 1, 1995 under other provisions of the CAAA. All\\ncompany activities had been conducted in accordance with authorization by the\\nSouth Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), the primary enforcing\\nagency of the rule that the EPA contends the company violated. EPA efforts to\\ncause the company to cease all construction activities were stayed by the Ninth\\nCircuit Court of Appeals, and SCAQMD has since issued the company a formal\\npermit to construct. The EPA also sought civil penalties from the company for\\nactivities conducted prior to the issuance of the permit. Chevron paid a penalty\\nof approximately $435,000 to settle the matter.\\n\\nOther previously reported legal proceedings have been settled or the issues\\nresolved so as not to merit further reporting\\n\\n                                    - 26 -\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nITEM 4.

However, special items, particularly\\nin 1995 and 1993, and a new accounting standard on asset impairment that was\\nadopted in 1995, affected the comparability of the company\\'s reported results.\\nSpecial items and the new accounting standard, after related tax effects,\\ndecreased reported earnings by $1.032 billion in 1995 and $883 million in 1993,\\nwhile increasing earnings by $22 million in 1994. Excluding the effects of the\\nnew accounting standard in 1995 and special items in all years, operating\\nearnings of $1.962 billion in 1995 were up 17 percent from the $1.671 billion\\nearned in 1994, but down 9 percent from 1993\\'s operating earnings of $2.148\\nbillion.\\n\\nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK. After four years of declining crude oil\\nprices, Chevron\\'s crude oil realizations increased in 1995. The company\\'s\\nU.S. realizations averaged $1.48 per barrel higher than in 1994, and\\ninternational realizations were up $1.24. However, worldwide crude oil supplies\\ncontinue to be plentiful and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable\\nfuture. Non-OPEC crude oil sources have proliferated, and OPEC member\\ncountries continue to influence crude oil prices through their production\\nlevels.\\n\\nOn the other hand, U.S. natural gas prices continued to decline, falling an\\naverage of 26 cents per thousand cubic feet to $1.51, as supplies of this\\ncommodity continue to exceed demand, which is heavily dependent on weather\\nconditions and the price of alternate fuels, such as fuel oil. The company\\'s\\ninternational gas realizations also were down an average 11 cents per thousand\\ncubic feet to $1.73.\\n\\nIndustry refined product sales margins continued to be weak worldwide throughout\\nthe year. U.S. refining margins were especially low in the Gulf Coast region,\\nand marketing margins were weak on both the Gulf and West Coasts, as ample\\nsupplies and a competitive marketplace prevented product prices from fully\\nreflecting the higher crude oil costs. These same reasons held down product\\nprices in the company\\'s international refining and marketing areas in the United\\nKingdom, Canada and, through its Caltex affiliate, the Asia-Pacific region.\\n\\nIn addition, Chevron\\'s U.S. refining operations were negatively affected by\\nsignificant refinery downtime in 1995 for planned major maintenance and, to a\\nlesser extent, for unplanned downtime due to refinery problems. The company\\'s\\nRichmond, California, refinery was down much of the fourth quarter for upgrades\\nrequired to produce California-mandated cleaner-burning gasolines.\\n\\nThe chemicals industry continued to strengthen in 1995\\'s first half, as strong\\ndemand translated to higher prices and increased sales volumes for Chevron\\'s\\nolefins and aromatics products. These favorable conditions peaked midyear and\\nsoftened throughout the second half of 1995 and into 1996. Also, the company\\'s\\nPort Arthur, Texas, ethylene unit was down for unplanned maintenance in early\\n1996. The company does not expect that 1996 chemicals results will be as strong\\nas 1995\\'s.\\n\\nUnusually cold weather in the eastern and central United States in late 1995 and\\ninto 1996 pushed natural gas prices sharply higher due to increased heating\\ndemand and low customer inventory levels. Crude oil prices also rose on\\nincreased heating oil demand. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price, an industry\\nmarker, was $2.91 per thousand cubic feet at year-end 1995 and continued to\\nincrease into 1996, but retreated to $2.72 by late February 1996. Chevron\\'s\\nposted price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a benchmark crude oil, was\\n$18.50 per barrel at year-end 1995 and $18.00 at February 23, 1996.\\n\\nChevron has no major refinery maintenance scheduled for 1996 and is positioned\\nto refine and market the California cleaner-burning gasolines mandated in the\\nsecond quarter. Weak industry sales margins have continued into 1996, and it is\\nuncertain whether the increased cost of manufacturing these fuels initially will\\nbe recovered in the marketplace. Also, customer acceptance of the new gasolines,\\ntogether with the overall industry supply and demand situation, could affect\\nthe company\\'s 1996 results.\\n\\nThe company continues to review its operations to improve its competitiveness\\nand profitability. In 1995, the decision was made to exit the real estate\\ndevelopment business, a non-core activity located in California, and completion\\nof the sale of these properties is expected in the first half of 1996.\\n\\nU.S. gasoline marketing is being reorganized to more efficiently serve the\\ncustomer by combining regional offices and consolidating support functions;\\nthe international and U.S. trading and lubricants businesses are being\\nintegrated into global organizations; and the chemicals operations are being\\nreorganized into geographic areas to facilitate international growth. Two staff\\nfunctions - Human Resources and Finance - are each adopting a shared services\\napproach to provide support to other Chevron organizations, and a new\\nfinancial information system is being installed throughout the company. All\\nthese initiatives are intended to help the company accomplish its strategic\\nintents more effectively and at a lower cost.\\n\\nIn December 1995, Chevron entered into a service agreement with Maraven, a\\nsubsidiary of Venezuela\\'s national oil\\n\\n                                    FS-1\\n<PAGE>\\n\\ncompany, to operate and further develop the Boscan heavy oil field in\\nVenezuela. The field currently produces about 80,000 barrels per day. As\\noperator, Chevron will receive a per-barrel fee. Concurrently, agreements were\\nentered into to supply heavy crude oil to four Chevron U.S. refineries and to\\nform a joint venture with Maraven to market Chevron-made asphalt in the\\nwestern United States. These activities are expected to be in full operation\\nby mid-1996.\\n\\nCaltex, Chevron\\'s 50 percent-owned refining and marketing affiliate, is selling\\nits 50 percent interest in a refining company in Japan to its partner, Nippon\\nOil Company, for about $2 billion. The sale, which will result in a significant\\ngain, is expected to be completed in the first half of 1996. The sales proceeds\\nare expected to fund dividends to the stockholders and to help fund Caltex\\nexpansion projects in higher-growth areas of the Asia-Pacific region. Caltex\\'s\\nnew grass-roots refinery in Thailand is scheduled for completion in mid-1996.\\n\\nIn January 1996, Chevron announced its intent to merge substantially all of its\\nU.S. natural gas liquids and natural gas marketing businesses with NGC\\nCorporation. The company believes the merger will position these activities for\\ngreater growth. If an agreement is reached, the transaction is expected to be\\ncompleted by midyear. Chevron will have, through common and preferred stock\\nholdings, an approximate 28 percent equity interest in the resulting company,\\nwhich will be North America\\'s largest natural gas marketer, as well as the\\nlargest processor and marketer of natural gas liquids. In addition, Chevron\\nexpects to negotiate separate agreements for the new company to market Chevron\\'s\\nNorth American natural gas production and provide energy and feedstock\\nrequirements to its refineries and chemicals facilities.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION DEVELOPMENTS. Production from\\nTengizchevroil (TCO), a 50 percent-owned joint venture with the Republic of\\nKazakstan, continues to be constrained by lack of sufficient export\\ncapability. In 1995, liquids production averaged 58,000 barrels per day, up\\nfrom 46,000 in 1994. At year end, daily production was at 64,000 barrels.\\nCrude oil production capacity currently is 95,000 barrels per day, which is\\nsignificantly less than the field\\'s potential. Further field development is\\ndependent upon the availability of additional export capability or the\\nsecuring of other marketing alternatives. The partners remain committed to\\nrealizing the full potential of the project and are developing additional\\nmarkets as they continue to explore political and commercial solutions to the\\nexport situation. Chevron\\'s cash investment in TCO at year-end 1995 was $717\\nmillion.\\n\\nChevron has significant oil-producing properties and major development projects\\nunder way in Nigeria and Angola\\'s Cabinda exclave, both of which continue to\\nexperience political uncertainty and civil unrest. Although its operations\\ngenerally have been unaffected, the company continues to closely monitor\\ndevelopments. In 1995, Chevron\\'s net share of production averaged 133,000 and\\n118,000 barrels per day in Nigeria and Angola, respectively. In prior years,\\nChevron\\'s partner in Nigeria, the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum\\nCorporation (NNPC), had fallen behind in paying its cash calls to Chevron and to\\nother oil companies operating in Nigeria. During 1995, NNPC made considerable\\nprogress in bringing its payments to a more-current basis.\\n\\nThe respective participants in the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea\\nStatfjord field have been unable to agree on an equity redetermination in the\\nfield and have submitted the matter for resolution by an independent expert.\\nChevron\\'s share of 1995 production from Statfjord was 28,000 oil and equivalent\\ngas barrels per day in 1995.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the\\ncompany engages are subject to various federal, state and local environmental,\\nhealth and safety laws and regulations. These regulatory requirements continue\\nto increase in both number and complexity, and govern not only the manner in\\nwhich the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Most\\nof the costs of complying with myriad laws and regulations pertaining to its\\noperations and products are embedded in the normal costs of conducting its\\nbusiness.\\n\\nUsing definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum\\nInstitute, Chevron estimates its worldwide environmental spending in 1995 was\\nabout $1.442 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these\\nexpenditures were $663 million of environmental capital expenditures and $779\\nmillion of costs associated with the control and abatement of hazardous\\nsubstances and pollutants from ongoing operations. The total amount also\\nincludes spending charged against reserves established in prior years for\\nenvironmental cleanup programs (but not non-cash provisions to increase these\\nreserves or establish new ones during the year).\\n\\nIn addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its\\nongoing operations and products, the company may incur expenses for corrective\\nactions at various current and previously owned facilities and waste-disposal\\nsites. An obligation to take remedial action may be incurred as a result of the\\nenactment of laws, such as the federal Superfund law, or the issuance of new\\nregulations, or as the result of the company\\'s own policies in this area.\\nAccidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course\\nof business. In addition, an obligation may arise when operations are closed or\\nsold, or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or\\ndisposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to\\nfacilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures\\nthat were considered acceptable under standards existing at the time, but now\\nrequire investigatory and/or remedial work to meet current standards.\\n\\nDuring 1995, the company recorded $140 million of before-tax provisions ($90\\nmillion after tax) for environmental remediation efforts, including Superfund\\nsites. Also, included in the company\\'s provision for the expected loss from\\nexiting its real estate development activities was $37 million ($24 million\\nafter tax) for estimated environmental cleanup liabilities retained in\\nconnection with the sale of certain properties. Actual expenditures charged\\nagainst these provisions and other previously established reserves amounted to\\n$162 million in\\n\\n                                    FS-2\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n1995. At year-end 1995, the company\\'s environmental remediation reserves were\\n$1.234 billion, including $60 million related to Superfund sites.\\n\\nUnder provisions of the Superfund law, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\\nhas designated Chevron a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) or has otherwise\\ninvolved it in the remediation of 251 hazardous waste sites. At year-end 1995,\\nthe company\\'s cumulative share of costs and settlements for approximately 174\\nof these sites, for which payments or provisions have been made in 1995 and\\nprior years, was about $131 million, including a provision of $17 million made\\nduring 1995. No single site is expected to result in a material liability for\\nthe company at this time. For the remaining sites, investigations are not yet at\\na stage where the company is able to quantify a probable liability or determine\\na range of reasonably possible exposure. The Superfund law provides for joint\\nand several liability. Any future actions by the EPA or other regulatory\\nagencies to require Chevron to assume other responsible parties\\' costs at\\ndesignated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on\\nthe company\\'s consolidated financial position or liquidity.\\n\\nIt is likely the company will continue to incur additional charges beyond those\\nreserved for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future\\ncosts are indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of\\npossible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions\\nthat may be required, the determination of the company\\'s liability in proportion\\nto other responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable\\nfrom third parties. While the amounts of future costs may be material to the\\ncompany\\'s results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, the\\ncompany does not expect these costs to have a material effect on its\\nconsolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does not believe\\nits obligations to make such expenditures have had or will have any significant\\nimpact on the company\\'s competitive position relative to other domestic or\\ninternational petroleum or chemicals concerns. Although environmental compliance\\ncosts are substantial, the company has no reason to believe they vary\\nsignificantly from similar costs incurred by other companies engaged in similar\\nbusinesses in similar areas. The company believes that such costs ultimately are\\nreflected in the petroleum and chemicals industries\\' prices for products and\\nservices.\\n\\nOver the past several years, the petroleum industry has incurred major capital\\nexpenditures to meet clean-air regulations, such as the 1990 amendments to the\\nClean Air Act in the United States. For companies operating in California, where\\nChevron has a significant presence, the California Air Resources Board has\\nimposed even stricter requirements. Over the past five years, Chevron spent\\napproximately $1.8 billion on capital projects to comply with air quality\\nrelated measures. The bulk of this required spending has been completed. For\\n1996, total estimated environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $244\\nmillion, compared with $663 million spent in 1995, reflecting the completion of\\nmajor air quality projects. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing\\ncosts of complying with other environmental regulations and the costs to\\nremediate previously contaminated sites.\\n\\nIn addition to the reserves for environmental remediation discussed above, the\\ncompany maintains reserves for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of its\\nworldwide oil, gas and coal properties at the end of their productive lives.\\nMost such costs are environmentally related. Provisions are recognized on a\\nunit-of-production basis as the properties are produced. The amount of these\\nreserves at year-end 1995 was $1.7 billion and is included in accumulated\\ndepreciation, depletion and amortization in the company\\'s consolidated balance\\nsheet.\\n\\nFor the company\\'s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries, no\\nprovisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such\\nassets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or\\notherwise abandon the facility has been made.\\n\\nOTHER CONTINGENCIES. At year-end 1995, the company had $250 million of\\nsuspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment. The\\nwells are suspended pending a final determination of the commercial potential\\nof the related oil and gas fields. These well costs will be capitalized or\\nexpensed depending on the results of future drilling activity and development\\ndecisions.\\n\\nThe company is the subject of various lawsuits and claims and other contingent\\nliabilities. These are discussed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated\\nfinancial statements. The company believes that the resolution of these matters\\nwill not materially affect its financial position or liquidity, although losses\\ncould be material with respect to earnings in any given period.\\n\\nThe company utilizes various derivative instruments to manage its exposure to\\nprice risk stemming from its integrated petroleum activities. Some of the\\ninstruments may be settled by delivery of the underlying commodity, whereas\\nothers can only be settled by cash. All these instruments are commonly used in\\nthe global trade of petroleum products and are relatively straightforward,\\ninvolve little complexity and, with the exception of certain long-term natural\\ngas swaps, are of a short-term duration. Most of the activity in these\\ninstruments is intended to hedge a physical transaction; hence gains and losses\\narising from these instruments offset, and are recognized concurrently with,\\ngains and losses from the underlying commodities. The company believes it has\\nno material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or\\nliquidity as a result of its commodities and other derivatives activities,\\nincluding forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, and that its\\ncontrol systems are designed to monitor and manage its financial exposures in\\naccordance with company policies and procedures.\\n\\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. Effective October 1, 1995, the company adopted a new\\naccounting standard, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121,\\n\"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets\\nto be Disposed Of.\" The adoption of this standard required non-cash charges\\namounting to $659 million after tax, mostly\\n\\n                                    FS-3\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nrelated to impairment write-downs of U.S. oil and gas producing properties.\\nImpairment of the properties under the new standard is determined on an\\nindividual field basis, whereas previously impairment was evaluated using an\\naggregated approach.\\n\\nSFAS No. 123, \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,\" establishes financial\\nand reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans, which will\\nbe effective for Chevron\\'s 1996 financial statements. The statement encourages,\\nbut does not require, companies to adopt a fair-value-based method of\\naccounting for such plans, in place of current accounting standards. Companies\\nelecting to continue their existing accounting must make pro forma disclosures\\nof net income as if the fair-value-based method of accounting had been applied.\\nThe company is evaluating the statement and has made no decision whether to\\nadopt the new accounting or continue its present accounting.\\n\\nSPECIAL ITEMS. Net income is affected by transactions that are unrelated to,\\nor are not representative of, the company\\'s ongoing operations for the\\nperiods presented. These transactions, defined by management and designated\\n\"special items,\" can obscure the underlying results of operations for a year\\nas well as affect comparability between years.

In 1995, an estimated loss of $168 million\\nwas recognized in connection with the company\\'s decision to exit its real estate\\ndevelopment business. Included in this charge was $24 million for anticipated\\nenvironmental remediation costs. Concurrent with implementing the new accounting\\nstandard for asset impairment in 1995, and in preparation for installation of\\nthe company\\'s new financial information system, a comprehensive review of all\\nthe company\\'s fixed assets was conducted. As a result of this review, asset\\nwrite-offs of $94 million were recorded. Also, the write-down of certain assets\\nmade obsolete by the conversion of two West Coast refineries to produce the new\\nCalifornia-mandated reformulated gasolines amounted to $38 million. Other\\nmiscellaneous asset write-offs in 1995 amounted to $4 million. In 1993, asset\\nwrite-offs of $71 million comprised certain U.S. refinery assets, U.S. and\\nCanadian production assets, and miscellaneous corporate assets.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PROVISIONS pertain to estimated future costs for\\nenvironmental cleanup programs at certain of the company\\'s U.S. service\\nstations, marketing terminals, refineries, chemical locations, and oil and gas\\nproperties; divested operations in which Chevron has liability for future\\ncleanup costs; and sites, commonly referred to as Superfund sites, for which the\\ncompany has been designated a PRP by the EPA. Provisions for environmental\\nremediation amounted to $90 million in 1995, $304 million in 1994 and $90\\nmillion in 1993.\\n\\nRESTRUCTURINGS AND REORGANIZATIONS charges in 1995 were $50 million, including\\n$12 million related to restructurings at Chevron\\'s Caltex affiliate, and\\nconsisted principally of voluntary and involuntary employee severance provisions\\nin connection with reorganizations of various business activities. The 1993\\ncharge of $554 million was composed primarily of a write-down of the company\\'s\\nPhiladelphia and Port Arthur, Texas, refinery facilities and related inventories\\nto their realizable values. In estimating the refineries\\' realizable values, the\\ncompany took into account certain environmental cleanup obligations. The charges\\nalso included provisions for environmental site assessments and employee\\nseverance. In 1994, a $45 million adjustment was made to the 1993 charge as the\\nresult of environmental remediation actions agreed to with regulatory agencies,\\nand retained by the company, in connection with the terms of the sale of the\\nPort Arthur refinery, and to recognize the effect of the refinery sale on the\\ncompany\\'s chemicals operations. The Philadelphia refinery was sold in August\\n1994, and the Port Arthur refinery sale was completed in February 1995. At\\nyear-end 1995, the balance remaining in the refineries\\' reserve was for\\nestimated environmental clean-up liabilities and was included in the company\\'s\\ntotal environmental reserves.\\n\\nPRIOR-YEAR TAX ADJUSTMENTS are generally the result of the settlement of audit\\nissues with taxing authorities or the re-evaluation by the company of its tax\\nliabilities as a result of new developments. Also, adjustments are required for\\nthe effect on deferred income taxes of changes in statutory tax rates. In 1995,\\ncharges for prior-year tax adjustments were $22 million, relating primarily to\\na change in the Australian income tax rate. Tax adjustments in 1994 increased\\nearnings $344 million, including the net reversal of $301 million of tax and\\nrelated interest reserves resulting from the company\\'s global settlement with\\nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for issues relating to the years 1979 through\\n1987. Tax adjustments decreased earnings $130 million in 1993, which included\\nthe effect of a one percent increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate.\\n\\nASSET DISPOSITIONS in 1995 increased earnings a net $7 million and consisted\\nof sales of a fertilizer plant, natural gas storage facility, and a small oil\\nand gas property in the United States. The 1994 sale of the company\\'s lead and\\nzinc prospect in Ireland generated an after-tax profit of $48 million. The\\nOrtho lawn and garden products business was the major asset sold in 1993,\\ngenerating a $130 million gain.\\n\\nLIFO INVENTORY LIQUIDATION GAINS (LOSSES) result from the reduction of\\ninventories in certain inventory pools valued under the Last-In, First-Out\\n(LIFO) accounting method. LIFO effects increased net income in 1995 by $2\\nmillion as inventories were liquidated at historical costs that were lower\\nthan the current year costs. LIFO losses decreased net income in 1994\\n\\n                                    FS-4\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nand 1993 by $10 million and $46 million, respectively, when inventories were\\nliquidated at historical costs that were higher than costs incurred in those\\nyears. These amounts include the company\\'s equity share of Caltex LIFO\\ninventory effects. Chevron\\'s consolidated petroleum inventories were 93\\nmillion barrels at year-end 1995 and 99 million barrels at year-end 1994 and\\n1993.\\n\\nOTHER SPECIAL ITEMS in 1995 benefited earnings a net $84 million. A gain of $86\\nmillion related to a sale of land by a Caltex affiliate in Japan and a refund of\\n$27 million for federal lease costs were offset partially by litigation and\\nother costs. Charges in 1994 for litigation and regulatory settlements of $31\\nmillion were offset partially by a casualty insurance recovery of $20 million.\\nIn 1993, net additions of $70 million to reserves for various litigation and\\nregulatory issues and a one-time cash bonus award to employees of $60 million,\\nwere offset partially by a favorable inventory adjustment of $16 million.\\n\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Operating results for 1995 were strong in all areas\\nexcept for U.S. downstream operations where very poor results severely\\naffected total earnings. Both chemicals and international upstream businesses\\nturned in record earnings, and U.S. upstream operations performed well\\ndespite low natural gas prices. International oil and gas production and\\nreserves increased for the sixth consecutive year. In 1995, international oil\\nand gas production was up 4 percent, and the company replaced about 178\\npercent of its international production through proved reserve additions,\\nresulting in a worldwide replacement rate of about 138 percent.\\n\\nU.S. downstream results in 1995 were affected by scheduled major maintenance\\nturnarounds at all the company\\'s core refineries, particularly an extended\\nturnaround of the Richmond, California, refinery to tie in new units required to\\nproduce the new California-mandated reformulated fuels. This, along with some\\nunplanned refinery problems and low industry refining margins, resulted in\\nseverely depressed earnings for these operations.\\n\\nResults for 1994 compared with 1993 were depressed by lower average crude oil\\nand natural gas prices and lower sales margins on refined products. Crude oil\\nprices were especially low in the first quarter of 1994, and U.S. refined\\nproducts margins were very weak in the second quarter. In addition to these\\nindustry conditions, the company experienced unscheduled refinery downtime and\\nother refinery operating problems at its U.S. operations that further reduced\\nearnings, particularly in the first half of 1994. Chemicals operations, however,\\nwere very strong, benefiting from improved industry fundamentals and the\\nrestructuring and cost-reduction programs undertaken in recent years.\\n\\nSALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES were $36.3 billion, compared with $35.1\\nbillion in 1994 and $36.2 billion in 1993. Revenues improved from 1994 primarily\\nbecause of higher prices for crude oil and refined products and higher chemicals\\nprices and sales volumes, partially offset by lower refined products sales\\nvolumes and lower natural gas prices. The decline in 1994 revenues from 1993 was\\ndue to lower prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, together\\nwith lower refined products sales volumes. Higher crude oil and refined products\\nprices, together with increased volumes of third-party purchased products,\\naccounted for the increases in PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS costs in 1995.\\n\\nOTHER INCOME in all years included net gains resulting from the disposition of\\nnon-core assets, which caused other income to fluctuate from year to year.\\n\\nOPERATING, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, adjusted for special items,\\ndeclined $272 million in 1995. Annual operating costs in 1995 were $1.3 billion\\nless than in 1991, the base measurement year set when the company launched its\\ncost-reduction program in early 1992. Although a portion of this cost reduction\\nis a result of operations disposed of over the years, much of the decrease is\\ndue to a significant reduction in the company\\'s ongoing cost structure.\\nOperating expenses in 1995 were negatively affected by scheduled refinery\\nshutdowns and maintenance. Unanticipated costs associated with unscheduled\\nrefinery shutdowns and other refinery operating problems also affected operating\\ncosts in both 1995 and 1994.\\n\\nReported selling, general and administrative expenses in 1994 were unusually low\\ndue to a reversal of $319 million of accrued interest reserves on federal income\\ntaxes payable resulting from the company\\'s settlement with the IRS of most\\nissues for nine open tax years.\\n\\nMillions of dollars                                1995       1994       1993\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperating Expenses                               $5,974     $6,383     $7,104\\nSelling, General and\\n    Administrative Expenses                       1,384        963      1,530\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Total Operational Costs                       7,358      7,346      8,634\\nEliminate Special Charges Before Tax               (514)      (230)    (1,368)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Adjusted Ongoing Operational Costs           $6,844     $7,116     $7,266\\n=============================================================================\\n\\nDEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION increased in 1995 from 1994 and 1993\\nbecause of the impairment of certain fixed assets together with other\\nadjustments to fixed asset carrying values.\\n\\nTAXES on income were $859 million in 1995, $1.110 billion in 1994 and $1.161\\nbillion in 1993, equating to effective income tax rates of 48 percent, 39.6\\npercent and 47.9 percent for each of the three years, respectively. The 1995 tax\\nrate reflected a shift in taxable earnings from lower tax-rate countries to\\nhigher tax-rate countries. This increase in the tax rate was offset partially by\\nhigher tax credits and an increase in equity earnings recorded on an after-tax\\nbasis. The lower 1994 tax rate is attributable to the effect of favorable prior\\nyear tax adjustments resulting from a global settlement with the IRS of most\\nissues for the years 1979 through 1987, which included the reversal of excess\\ninterest reserves with little associated tax effect. Taxes in 1993 included\\nunfavorable prior-year tax adjustments, including a one percent increase in the\\nstatutory U.S. corporate income tax rate.\\n\\nCURRENCY TRANSACTIONS decreased net income $15 million and $64 million in 1995\\nand 1994, respectively, compared with an increase of $46 million in 1993. These\\namounts include the company\\'s share of affiliates\\' currency transactions. The\\nloss on currency transactions in 1995 resulted from fluctu-\\n\\n                                    FS-5\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nations in the value of the Canadian and Nigerian currencies relative to the\\nU.S. dollar, while in 1994 it was due primarily to fluctuations in the value\\nof the Australian and Philippine currencies.

Net natural gas production in 1995 averaged about 1.9 billion\\ncubic feet per day, compared with 2.1 billion cubic feet per day in 1994 and\\n1993.

Shipping results\\nimproved on higher ocean freight rates and lower operating expenses. There was\\nalso a modest improvement in earnings reported by the company\\'s Caltex affiliate\\ndespite poor refining margins throughout its major operating areas in the Asia\\nPacific region and South Africa. Compared with 1993, earnings in 1994 also\\nreflected lower results from the company\\'s United Kingdom operations which\\nexperienced an explosion and fire at the cracking facility that manufactures its\\ngasoline. All three years reflected weak industry conditions that held down\\nproduct prices, resulting in shrinking sales margins in the company\\'s major\\nareas of operations.\\n\\nInternational sales volumes for 1995 increased 4 percent over 1994 levels, due\\nto higher Caltex sales volumes and increased sales in Chevron\\'s international\\ntrading operations. Sales in 1994 and 1993 were about flat as a 5 percent\\nincrease in marketing sales in 1994 was offset mostly by a decline in the\\ncompany\\'s trading sales volumes. Caltex volumes, excluding transactions with\\nChevron, increased 6 percent from 1994 and 4 percent from 1993 to 1994,\\ncontinuing its growth over the past several years.\\n\\nEquity earnings of Caltex were $294 million, $210 million and $227 million for\\n1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. In 1995, Chevron\\'s share of Caltex earnings\\nincluded an $86 million benefit from a gain related to a land sale by a Caltex\\naffiliate in Japan. This gain was offset partially by other special items\\nnetting to $18 million related to Caltex restructurings and asset write-offs. In\\n1995 and 1994, Chevron\\'s share of Caltex earnings benefited $13 million and $15\\nmillion, respectively, from upward adjustments to the carrying value of its\\npetroleum inventories to reflect market values after a 1993 write-down of $52\\nmillion. Also, 1995 results included $13 million of favorable foreign tax\\nbenefits. Caltex foreign currency transactions resulted in gains of $26 million\\nin 1995, losses of $27 million in 1994 and gains of $16 million in 1993.\\n\\nTotal international refining and marketing foreign currency transactions\\namounted to gains of $19 million in 1995, losses of $19 million in 1994 and\\ngains of $2 million in 1993.\\n\\nCHEMICALS reported record earnings, excluding special items, that were up\\ndramatically from 1994 and 1993 levels, reflecting higher sales volumes and\\nproduct prices. However, during the second half of 1995, industry conditions\\nbegan to soften, and falling prices for the company\\'s major products, coupled\\nwith increased feedstock costs, caused earnings to decline from the first half\\nof the year. Nevertheless, operating results were strong in all the company\\'s\\ndivisions - additives, aromatics and olefins.

Interest expense in 1994 was\\nhigher than 1993 due to the combined effect of higher debt levels and higher\\ninterest rates.\\n\\nCorporate charges in 1995 and 1994 were higher than in 1993 because the company\\nchanged its method of distributing certain corporate expenses to its business\\nsegments in 1994. As a result, corporate and other charges for 1995 and 1994\\nincluded $226 million and $190 million, respectively, that under the previous\\nmethod, would have been allocated to the business segments. This change had no\\nnet income effect.\\n\\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable\\nsecurities increased $88 million to $1.4 billion at year-end 1995. Cash\\nprovided by operating activities in 1995 was $4.1 billion, compared with $2.9\\nbillion in 1994 and $4.2 billion in 1993. The 1995 increase reflects higher\\noperational earnings, adjusted for non-cash charges, and lower working capital\\nrequirements, including the absence of the 1994 payment of $675 million to the\\nInternal Revenue Service for the settlement of several years of open tax\\nissues. Cash from operations, proceeds from asset sales and an increase in\\noverall debt levels were used to fund the company\\'s capital expenditures and\\ndividend payments to stockholders.\\n\\nAt year-end 1995, the company classified $1.8 billion of short-term obligations\\nas long-term debt. Settlement of these obligations, consisting of commercial\\npaper, is not expected to require the use of working capital in 1996 because the\\ncompany has the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit\\narrangements, to refinance them on a long-term basis. The company\\'s practice has\\nbeen to continually refinance its commercial paper, maintaining levels it\\nbelieves to be appropriate.\\n\\nOn December 31, 1995, Chevron had $4.4 billion in committed credit facilities\\nwith various major banks. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing\\nand can also be used for general credit requirements. No borrowings were\\noutstanding under these facilities during the year or at year-end 1995. In\\naddition, Chevron and one of its subsidiaries each have existing \"shelf\"\\nregistrations on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that together\\nwould permit registered offerings of up to $1.3 billion of debt securities.\\n\\nThe company\\'s debt and capital lease obligations totaled $8.327 billion at\\nDecember 31, 1995, up $185 million from $8.142 billion at year-end 1994. The\\nincrease is primarily the issuance of $282 million in capital lease obligations\\nassociated with the sale and leaseback of four vessels, $160 million of 7.61\\npercent notes due in 2003, and $51 million of 6.92 percent notes due in 2005.\\nThese increases were offset partially by $227 million in repayments of net\\nshort-term borrowings, largely commercial paper, and miscellaneous other debt\\nrepayments of $98 million. The company also retired $50 million of debt related\\nto the Employee Stock Ownership Plan in January 1995.\\n\\nThe company\\'s future debt level is dependent primarily on its capital spending\\nprogram and its business outlook. While the company does not currently expect\\nits debt level to increase significantly during 1996, it believes it has\\nsubstantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements.\\n\\n                                    FS-9\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nFINANCIAL RATIOS\\n\\nThe CURRENT RATIO is the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at year\\nend. Two items affect the current ratio negatively, which in the company\\'s\\nopinion do not affect its liquidity. Included in current assets in all years are\\ninventories valued on a LIFO basis, which at year-end 1995 were lower than\\ncurrent costs by $917 million. Also, the company\\'s practice of continually\\nrefinancing its commercial paper, $3.0 billion classified as short-term at year\\nend 1995, results in a large portion of its short-term debt being outstanding\\nindefinitely. The INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO is defined as income before income tax\\nexpense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized\\ninterest, divided by before-tax interest costs. Chevron\\'s interest coverage\\nratio decreased in 1995 due to lower before-tax income and higher interest\\nexpense. The company\\'s DEBT RATIO (total debt to total debt plus equity)\\nincreased slightly in 1995, as total debt increased and stockholders\\' equity\\ndecreased year to year, due to the charge against earnings from the adoption of\\nthe new accounting standard.\\n\\nFINANCIAL RATIOS\\n                                                   1995       1994       1993\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCurrent Ratio                                       0.8        0.8        0.8\\nInterest Coverage Ratio                             4.1        7.6        7.4\\nTotal Debt/Total Debt Plus Equity                  36.7%      35.8%      35.0%\\n=============================================================================\\n\\nThe company\\'s senior debt is rated AA by Standard & Poor\\'s Corporation and Aa2\\nby Moody\\'s Investors Service.

Expenditures\\nfor exploration and production accounted for 57 percent of total outlays in 1995\\nand 1994, compared with 53 percent in 1993. International exploration and\\nproduction spending was 68 percent of worldwide exploration and production\\nexpenditures in 1995, down slightly from 71 percent in 1994 and about the same\\npercentage as in 1993, reflecting the company\\'s continued focus on international\\nexploration and production activities.\\n\\nTHE COMPANY PROJECTS 1996 CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AT APPROXIMATELY\\n$5.3 BILLION, including Chevron\\'s share of spending by affiliates; this is up\\nabout 10 percent from 1995 levels. The 1996 program provides $3.0 billion in\\nexploration and production investments, of which about 65 percent is for\\ninternational projects. Several long-term development projects in the Gulf of\\nMexico designed to stabilize U.S. oil and gas production account for a projected\\n19 percent increase in U.S. exploration and production expenditures.\\n\\nThe company is participating in several significant oil and gas development\\nprojects. These projects include the continuing development of the Hibernia oil\\nfield off the coast of Newfoundland; steam- and water-flood projects in\\nIndonesia; expansion of the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas project in\\nAustralia; development of the Britannia gas field and the expansion of the Alba\\noil field in the North Sea; development of the N\\'Kossa and Kitina projects and\\ndelineation work at the Moho discovery in Congo; continued development of the\\nEscravos Gas Project in Nigeria; development of Areas \"B\" and \"C\" in Angola;\\ncontinuing enhanced oil recovery projects in California; and continued\\ndevelopment in the Norphlet Trend natural gas and Green Canyon deep-water oil\\nprojects in the Gulf of Mexico. The TCO joint venture plans to fund an increase\\nin production capacity from 95,000 to 130,000 barrels per day if an expected\\nincrease in crude oil sales occurs.\\n\\nRefining, marketing and transportation expenditures are estimated at about $1.5\\nbillion, with $890 million of that planned for international projects.\\nCompletion in 1995 of the company\\'s U.S. refinery upgrade projects to produce\\nCalifornia-mandated fuels will result in lower total spending in the U.S.\\ndownstream areas by 36 percent to $570 million in 1996, but spending will\\nincrease 40 percent to $282 million for domestic marketing projects. Most of the\\ninternational capital program will be focused on high-growth Asia-Pacific Rim\\ncountries where the company\\'s Caltex affiliate has several major refinery\\nprojects under way to increase capacity and meet rising demand as well as a\\nmajor project to upgrade its retail marketing system. Chemicals spending also\\nwill increase substantially, with expansion projects at the ethylene facilities\\nin Port Arthur, Texas, the paraxylene plant in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the\\npolystyrene plant in Marietta, Ohio, and the construction of a fuel and lube oil\\nadditives plant in Singapore, and through a joint venture, a benzene and\\ncyclohexane complex in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\nCAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                             1995                       1994                       1993\\n                                  ------------------------   ------------------------   ------------------------\\n                                           INTER-                     Inter-                     Inter-\\nMillions of dollars                  U.S. NATIONAL   TOTAL      U.S. national   Total      U.S. national   Total\\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n<S>                               <C>     <C>       <C>      <C>     <C>       <C>      <C>     <C>       <C>\\nExploration and Production         $  879   $1,835  $2,714    $  807   $1,931  $2,738    $  763   $1,599  $2,362\\nRefining, Marketing \\n  & Transportation                    892      839   1,731       885      890   1,775       949      748   1,697\\nChemicals                             172       32     204       109       29     138       199       34     233\\nCoal and Other Minerals                40        1      41        39       15      54        47       10      57\\nAll Other                             110        -

FS-15\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nMillions of dollars\\n\\n\\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Chevron Corporation is an\\ninternational company that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, engages in\\nfully integrated petroleum operations, chemical operations and coal mining\\nin the United States and approximately 95 other countries. Petroleum operations\\nconsist of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas;\\ntransporting crude oil, natural gas and products by pipelines, marine vessels\\nand motor equipment; refining crude oil into finished petroleum products; and\\nmarketing crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products. Chemicals\\noperations include the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of chemicals\\nfor industrial uses.\\n\\nIn preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company follows\\naccounting policies that are in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples in the United States. This requires the use of estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses\\nreported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes\\nthereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. While\\nthe company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ\\nfrom these estimates as future confirming events occur. The company believes\\nthat the effect of any such changes in the near term would not have a material\\neffect on the financial statements.\\n\\nThe nature of the company\\'s operations and the many countries in which it\\noperates subject it to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions.\\nAlso, the company imports crude oil for its U.S. refining operations. The\\ncompany does not believe it is vulnerable to the risk of a near-term severe\\nimpact as a result of any concentration of its activities.\\n\\nSUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES The consolidated financial statements\\ninclude the accounts of subsidiary companies more than 50 percent owned.\\nInvestments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a\\nsubstantial ownership interest of approximately 20 to 50 percent, or for which\\nthe company participates in policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity\\nmethod. Under this accounting, remaining unamortized cost is increased or\\ndecreased by the company\\'s share of earnings or losses after dividends.\\n\\nOIL AND GAS ACCOUNTING The successful efforts method of accounting is used\\nfor oil and gas exploration and production activities.\\n\\nDERIVATIVES Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are\\nincluded in the carrying amounts of those assets or liabilities and are\\nultimately recognized in income as part of those carrying amounts. Gains and\\nlosses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated\\ntransactions also are deferred and are recognized in income or as adjustments\\nof carrying amounts when the underlying hedged transaction occurs. If,\\nsubsequent to being hedged, underlying transactions are no longer likely to\\noccur, the related derivatives gains and losses are recognized currently in\\nincome. Gains and losses on derivatives contracts that do not qualify as\\nhedges are recognized currently in \"Other income.\"\\n\\nSHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS All short-term investments are classified as available\\nfor sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are\\npart of the company\\'s cash management portfolio with original maturities of\\nthree months or less are reported as cash equivalents. The balance of the\\nshort-term investments is reported as marketable securities.\\n\\nINVENTORIES Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are stated at cost,\\nusing a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method. In the aggregate, these costs are\\nbelow market. Materials, supplies and other inventories generally are stated\\nat average cost.\\n\\nPROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT All costs for development wells, related\\nplant and equipment (including carbon dioxide and certain other injected\\nmaterials used in enhanced recovery projects), and mineral interests in oil\\nand gas properties are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are\\ncapitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves.\\nCosts of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. All\\nother exploratory wells and costs are expensed.\\n\\nBeginning in 1995, long-lived assets, including proved oil and gas properties,\\nare assessed for possible impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS\\n121. Under this standard, the occurrence of certain events may trigger a review\\nof affected assets for possible impairment. For proved oil and gas properties,\\nthe company would typically perform the review on an individual field basis. An\\nimpairment is deemed to exist if the sum of undiscounted before-tax expected\\nfuture cash flows for the asset are less than the asset\\'s carrying value. If an\\nimpairment is indicated, the amount of the impairment is measured as the\\ndifference between the asset\\'s fair market value and its net book value. Where a\\nmarket value is not available, it is approximated by the company\\'s best estimate\\nof the sum of discounted future before-tax cash flows. Impairment amounts are\\nrecorded as incremental depreciation expense in the period in which the specific\\nevent occurred.\\n\\nPrior to the adoption of SFAS 121, proved oil and gas properties were regularly\\nassessed for possible impairment on an aggregate worldwide portfolio basis,\\napplying the informal \"ceiling test\" of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nUnder this method, the possibility of an impairment existed if the aggregate net\\nbook carrying value of these properties, net of applicable deferred income\\ntaxes, exceeded the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, after tax, from\\nthe properties, as calculated in accordance with accounting rules for\\nsupplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. In addition, high\\ncost, long-lead-time oil and gas projects were individually assessed prior to\\nproduction start-up by comparing the recorded investment in the project with its\\nfair market or economic value, as appropriate. Economic values were generally\\nbased on management\\'s expectations of discounted future after-tax cash flows\\nfrom the project at the time of assessment.\\n\\nDepreciation and depletion (including provisions for future abandonment and\\nrestoration costs) of all capitalized costs of proved oil and gas producing\\nproperties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production\\n\\n                                    FS-16\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\\nPOLICIES - Continued\\n\\nmethod by individual fields as the proved developed reserves are produced.\\nDepletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are\\nrecognized using the unit-of-production method by individual fields as the\\nrelated proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation provisions for\\nimpairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.\\n\\nDepreciation and depletion expenses for coal are determined using the unit-of-\\nproduction method as the proved reserves are produced. The capitalized costs of\\nall other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over estimated useful\\nlives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and\\nequipment in the United States; the straight-line method generally is used to\\ndepreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized\\nleased assets.\\n\\nGains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant\\nand equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or\\nlosses from abnormal retirements or sales are included in income.\\n\\nExpenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities\\nin operating condition are expensed. Major replacements and renewals are\\ncapitalized.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES Environmental expenditures that relate to current\\nongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed.\\nExpenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue\\ngeneration are capitalized.\\n\\nLiabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental\\nassessments and/or cleanups are probable, and the costs can be reasonably\\nestimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these\\naccruals are generally based on the company\\'s commitment to a formal plan of\\naction, such as an approved remediation plan or the sale or disposal of an\\nasset. For the company\\'s domestic marketing facilities, the accrual is based on\\nthe probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. For oil\\nand gas and coal producing properties, a provision is made through depreciation\\nexpense for anticipated abandonment and restoration costs at the end of the\\nproperty\\'s useful life.\\n\\nFor Superfund sites, the company records a liability for its share of costs when\\nit has been named as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) and when an\\nassessment or cleanup plan has been developed. This liability includes the\\ncompany\\'s own portion of the costs and also the company\\'s portion of amounts for\\nother PRPs when it is probable that they will not be able to pay their share of\\nthe cleanup obligation.\\n\\nThe company records the gross amount of its liability based on its best estimate\\nof future costs in current dollars and using currently available technology and\\napplying current regulations as well as the company\\'s own internal environmental\\npolicies. Future amounts are not discounted. Probable recoveries or\\nreimbursements are recorded as an asset.\\n\\nCURRENCY TRANSLATION The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the\\ncompany\\'s consolidated operations as well as for substantially all operations\\nof its equity method companies. For those operations, all gains or losses\\nfrom currency transactions are included in income currently. The cumulative\\ntranslation effects for the few equity affiliates using functional currencies\\nother than the U.S. dollar are included in the currency translation adjustment\\nin stockholders\\' equity.\\n\\nTAXES Income taxes are accrued for retained earnings of international\\nsubsidiaries and corporate joint ventures intended to be remitted. Income taxes\\nare not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have\\nbeen, or are intended to be, reinvested indefinitely.\\n\\nNOTE 2. SPECIAL ITEMS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Net income is affected by\\ntransactions that are unrelated to or are not representative of the company\\'s\\nongoing operations for the periods presented. These transactions, defined by\\nmanagement and designated \"special items,\" can obscure the underlying results\\nof operations for a year as well as affect comparability of results between\\nyears.\\n\\nListed below are categories of special items and their net (decrease) increase\\nto net income, after related tax effects:\\n\\n                                                       Year ended December 31\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                   1995       1994       1993\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAsset write-offs and revaluations\\n  New accounting standard                       $  (659)      $  -       $  -\\n  Real estate development assets                   (168)         -          -\\n  Adjustment of fixed assets records                (94)         -          -\\n  Refining and marketing assets                     (38)         -        (24)\\n  Oil and gas properties                              -          -        (31)\\n  Other                                              (4)         -        (16)\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                   (963)         -        (71)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nEnvironmental remediation provisions                (90)      (304)       (90)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRestructurings and reorganizations\\n  Workforce reductions                              (38)         -        (11)\\n  Caltex                                            (12)         -          -\\n  U.S. refining and marketing                         -        (39)      (543)\\n  Chemicals                                           -         (6)         -\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                    (50)       (45)      (554)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nPrior-year tax adjustments                          (22)       344       (130)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAsset dispositions, net\\n  Oil and gas properties                              6          -        (25)\\n  Lead and zinc property in Ireland                   -         48          -\\n  Ortho lawn and garden products                      -          -        130\\n  Other                                               1          -         17\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                      7         48        122\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLIFO inventory gains (losses)                         2        (10)       (46)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOther, net\\n  Caltex gain related to land sale                   86          -          -\\n  Federal lease cost refund                          27          -          -\\n  Litigation and regulatory issues                  (23)       (31)       (70)\\n  One-time employee bonus                             -          -        (60)\\n  Miscellaneous, net                                 (6)        20         16\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                     84        (11)      (114)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTotal special items, after tax                  $(1,032)     $  22      $(883)\\n=============================================================================\\n\\n                                    FS-17\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nNOTE 2. SPECIAL ITEMS AND OTHER FINANCIAL\\nINFORMATION - Continued\\n\\nDuring 1995, the company and its Caltex affiliate committed to restructurings\\nand reorganizations of several of their businesses and activities. After-tax\\nprovisions totaling $50 were recorded, substantially all of which related to\\nemployee severance programs for which the number of employees had been\\nidentified and terms and benefits had been communicated. It is expected the\\nprograms will be completed during 1996.\\n\\nDuring 1993 and 1994, after-tax provisions totaling $588 were recorded for the\\nfinancial effects of the company\\'s decision to sell two refineries. One of the\\nrefineries was sold in 1994, and the sale of the other was completed in early\\n1995. After completion of the sales, the remaining reserve balance of $224 was\\nfor estimated environmental cleanup obligations retained by the company, in\\nexcess of previously established reserves for these refineries, and was\\nclassified with the company\\'s other environmental reserves.\\n\\nOther financial information is as follows:\\n\\n                                                       Year ended December 31\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                   1995       1994       1993\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTotal financing interest and debt costs            $543       $419       $371\\nLess: capitalized interest                          142         73         54\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nInterest and debt expense                           401        346        317\\nResearch and development expenses                   185        179        206\\nCurrency transaction (losses) gains*               $(15)      $(64)      $ 46\\n=============================================================================\\n*INCLUDES $25, $(24) AND $18 IN 1995, 1994 AND 1993, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE\\n COMPANY\\'S SHARE OF AFFILIATES\\' CURRENCY TRANSACTION EFFECTS.\\n\\nThe excess of current cost (based on average acquisition costs for the year)\\nover the carrying value of inventories for which the LIFO method is used was\\n$917, $684 and $671 at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.\\n\\nNOTE 3. ADOPTION OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD (SFAS) NO.\\n121, \"ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED\\nASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF\" Effective October 1, 1995, the company and its\\naffiliates adopted SFAS 121 issued by the Financial Accounting Standards\\nBoard. The adoption of this standard required non-cash charges to 1995 net\\nincome amounting to $659, or $1.01 per share, after related income tax\\nbenefits of $358, and was mostly related to impairment writedowns of U.S. oil\\nand gas producing properties.\\n\\nNOTE 4. INFORMATION RELATING TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The\\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes the following non-cash\\ntransactions:\\n\\nCapital lease arrangements of $282 and $65 in 1995 and 1994, respectively, were\\nrecorded as additions to \"Properties, plant and equipment,\" \"Deferred charges\\nand other assets,\" and \"Capital lease obligations.\\n\\nThe company\\'s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) repaid $50 and $40 of matured\\ndebt guaranteed by Chevron Corporation in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The\\ncompany reflected this payment as reductions in \"Short-term debt\" and in\\n\"Deferred compensation - ESOP.\"\\n\\nIn 1993, the company acquired a 50 percent interest in the Tengizchevroil joint\\nventure (TCO) in the Republic of Kazakstan through a series of cash and non-cash\\ntransactions. The company\\'s interest in TCO is accounted for using the equity\\nmethod of accounting and is recorded in \"Investments and advances\" in the\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The cash expended in connection with the formation\\nof TCO and subsequent advances to TCO have been included in the Consolidated\\nStatement of Cash Flows in \"Capital expenditures.\" The deferred payment portion\\nof the TCO investment totaled $461 and $466 at year-end 1995 and 1994,\\nrespectively, and is recorded in \"Accrued liabilities\" and \"Deferred credits and\\nother non-current obligations\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Payments\\nrelated to the deferred portion of the TCO investment were classified as\\n\"Repayments of long-term debt and other financing obligations\" in the\\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\\n\\nThe company refinanced an aggregate amount of $334 in tax-exempt long-term debt\\nand capital lease obligations in 1993.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\\n\\nOFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK The company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments,\\nboth financial and commodity based, as hedges to manage a small portion of its\\nexposure to price volatility stemming from its integrated petroleum activities.\\nRelatively straightforward and involving little complexity, these instruments\\nconsist mainly of crude oil and natural gas futures contracts traded on the New\\nYork Mercantile Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange, and natural\\ngas swap contracts, entered into principally with major financial institutions.\\nThe futures contracts hedge anticipated crude oil and natural gas purchases and\\nsales, generally forecasted to occur within a 60-day period. Natural gas swaps\\nare primarily used to hedge firmly committed sales, and the terms of the swap\\ncontracts held have an average maturity of 20 months. Gains and losses on these\\nderivative instruments offset and are recognized concurrently with gains and\\nlosses from the underlying commodities. In addition, the company in 1995 entered\\ninto a managed program utilizing natural gas contracts to take advantage of\\nperceived opportunities for favorable price movements in this commodity. The\\nresults of this program are reflected currently in income and were not material\\nin 1995.\\n\\nThe company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with terms of 90\\ndays or less, as a hedge against some of its foreign currency exposures,\\nprimarily anticipated purchase transactions forecasted to occur within 90 days.\\n\\nThe company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to\\nmanage the interest rate risk on its debt. Under the terms of the swaps, net\\ncash settlements, based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate\\ninterest amounts calculated by reference to agreed notional principal amounts,\\nare made either semiannually or annually, and are recorded monthly as \"Interest\\nand debt expense.\" At December 31, 1995, the seven contracts have remaining\\nterms of between one and ten years.\\n\\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The company\\'s financial instruments that are\\nexposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash\\nequivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and\\ntrade receivables.\\n\\nThe company\\'s short-term investments are placed with various foreign governments\\nand a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. This\\ndiversified investment policy limits the company\\'s exposure both to credit risk\\nand to concentration of credit risk. Similar standards of diversity and\\ncreditworthiness are applied to the company\\'s counterparties in derivative\\ninstruments.\\n\\nThe trade receivable balances, reflecting the company\\'s diversified sources of\\nrevenue, are dispersed among the company\\'s broad customer base worldwide. As a\\nconsequence, concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely\\nassesses the financial strength of its customers. Letters of credit are the\\nprincipal security obtained to support lines of credit or negotiated contracts\\nwhen the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient.\\n\\nFAIR VALUE Fair values are derived either from quoted market prices where\\navailable or, in their absence, the present value of the expected cash flows.\\nThe fair values reflect the cash that would have been received or paid if the\\ninstruments were settled at year-end. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the fair\\nvalues of the financial and derivative instruments were as follows:\\n\\nLong-term debt of $2,333 and $2,155 had estimated fair values of $2,492 and\\n$2,127.\\n\\nThe notional principal amounts of the interest rate swaps totaled $1,223 and\\n$850, with approximate fair values totaling $(26) and $33. The notional amounts\\nof these and other derivative instruments do not represent assets or liabilities\\nof the company but, rather, are the basis for the settlements under the contract\\nterms.\\n\\nThe company holds cash equivalents and U.S. dollar marketable securities in\\ndomestic and offshore portfolios. Eurodollar bonds and floating-rate notes are\\nthe primary instruments held. Cash equivalents and marketable securities had\\nfair values of $1,219 and $1,178. Of these balances, $446 and $285 classified as\\ncash equivalents had average maturities under 90 days, while the remainder,\\nclassified as marketable securities, had average maturities of one year and four\\nyears.\\n\\nFor other derivatives the contract or notional values for 1995 and 1994 were as\\nfollows: Crude oil and natural gas futures had contract values of $57 and $68.\\nForward exchange contracts had contract values of $102 and $60. The fair values\\nfor these derivative instruments approximated their contract values. Gas swap\\ncontracts, based on notional gas volumes of approximately 180 and 149 billion\\ncubic feet, had negative fair values totaling $(33) and $(38). Deferred gains\\nand losses that have been accrued on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are not\\nmaterial.\\n\\nNOTE 7. SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL DATA - CHEVRON U.S.A. INC.

At\\nDecember 31, 1995 and 1994, \"Corporate and Other\" included $1,349 and $1,259 of\\nidentifiable assets that in previous years would have been included in the\\nidentifiable assets of the business segments.\\n\\nThese changes resulted in an increase to 1995 and 1994 U.S. Petroleum operating\\nincome of $121 and $101, and for international petroleum $132 and $111,\\nrespectively. Identifiable assets at December 31, 1995 and 1994, for U.S.\\nPetroleum were reduced $632 and $630, and for International Petroleum, $583 and\\n$506, respectively.

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS The U.S. federal income\\ntax and California franchise tax liabilities of the company have been settled\\nthrough 1976 and 1987, respectively. For federal income tax purposes, all\\nissues other than the allocation of state income taxes and the creditability\\nof taxes paid to the government of Indonesia have been resolved through 1987.\\nA Tax Court decision in 1995 confirmed the validity of tax regulations for\\nallocating state income taxes. The company currently is working with the\\nInternal Revenue Service to agree on a methodology that could apply to all\\nyears. The Indonesia issue applies only to years after 1982. While the amounts\\nunder dispute with the IRS are significant, settlement of open tax matters is\\nnot expected to have a material effect on the consolidated net assets or\\nliquidity of the company, and in the opinion of management, adequate provision\\nhas been made for income and franchise taxes for all years either under\\nexamination or subject to future examination.\\n\\nAt December 31, 1995, the company and its subsidiaries, as direct or indirect\\nguarantors, had contingent liabilities of $100 for notes of affiliated companies\\nand $77 for notes of others.\\n\\nThe company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with\\nrespect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments,\\nthroughput agreements and\\n\\n                                    FS-27\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nNOTE 18.

Total payments under the agreements were $173 in 1995, $154 in 1994\\nand $142 in 1993.\\n\\nIn March 1992, an agency within the Department of Energy (DOE) issued a Proposed\\nRemedial Order (PRO) claiming Chevron failed to comply with DOE regulations in\\nthe course of its participation in the Tertiary Incentive Program. Although the\\nDOE regulations involved were rescinded in March 1981, following decontrol of\\ncrude oil prices in January 1981, and the statute authorizing the regulations\\nexpired in September 1981, the PRO purports to be for the period April 1980\\nthrough April 1990. The DOE claimed the company overrecouped under the\\nregulations by $125 during the period in question but is currently requesting\\nthat the DOE\\'s Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) amend the amount to $167. If\\nthe amendment is granted, the total claim, including interest through December\\n1995, amounts to $442. The company asserts that in fact it incurred a loss\\nthrough participation in the DOE program. Evidentiary hearings on the no-benefit\\nargument began in mid-December 1994 and were concluded in March 1995. Oral\\narguments were held in August 1995 and the company is awaiting a decision by the\\nOHA.\\n\\nThe company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and\\nregulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct\\nor ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of\\nchemical or petroleum substances by the company or other parties. Such\\ncontingencies may exist for various sites including, but not limited to:\\nSuperfund sites and refineries, oil fields, service stations, terminals and land\\ndevelopment areas, whether operating, closed or sold. The amount of such future\\ncost is indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible\\ncontamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may\\nbe required, the determination of the company\\'s liability in proportion to other\\nresponsible parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from\\nthird parties. While the company has provided for known environmental\\nobligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of future\\ncosts may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are\\nrecognized. The company does not expect these costs to have a material effect on\\nits consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does not\\nbelieve its obligations to make such expenditures has had or will have any\\nsignificant impact on the company\\'s competitive position relative to other\\ndomestic or international petroleum or chemical concerns.\\n\\nThe company\\'s operations, particularly oil and gas exploration and production,\\ncan be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in\\nthe various countries, including the United States, in which it operates. In\\ncertain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and\\ntaxes, and in others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the\\nsafety of employees and the company\\'s continued presence in those countries.\\nInternal unrest or strained relations between a host government and the company\\nor other governments may affect the company\\'s operations. Those developments\\nhave, at times, significantly affected the company\\'s related operations and\\nresults, and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of\\ncurrent and future activity in such countries.\\n\\nAreas in which the company has significant operations include the United States,\\nCanada, Australia, United Kingdom, Congo, Angola, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea,\\nIndonesia, China and Zaire. The company\\'s Caltex affiliates have significant\\noperations in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Australia, the Philippines, Singapore,\\nThailand and South Africa.

Due to the\\ninherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of\\nunderground reserves are subject to change over time as additional information\\nbecomes available.\\n\\nProved reserves do not include additional quantities recoverable beyond the term\\nof the lease or contract unless renewal is reasonably certain, or that may\\nresult from extensions of currently proved areas, or from application of\\nsecondary or tertiary recovery processes not yet tested and determined to be\\neconomic.\\n\\nProved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through\\nexisting wells with existing equipment and operating methods.\\n\\n\"Net\" reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect\\ncontractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the\\nestimate.\\n\\nProved reserves for Tengizchevroil (TCO), the company\\'s 50 percent owned\\naffiliate in Kazakstan, do not include reserves that will be produced when a\\ndedicated export system is in place.\\n\\n                                    FS-32\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nTABLE IV -

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO\\nPROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES\\n\\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the\\nabove proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the\\nrequirements of SFAS 69. Estimated future cash inflows from production are\\ncomputed by applying year-end prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities of\\nestimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are limited to those\\nprovided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting\\nyear. Future development and production costs are those estimated future\\nexpenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end estimated proved reserves\\nbased on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end economic\\nconditions. Estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate\\nyear-end statutory tax rates. These rates reflect allowable deductions and tax\\ncredits and are applied to estimated future pre-tax net cash flows, less the tax\\nbasis of related assets. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using\\n10 percent midperiod discount factors. This discounting requires a year-by-year\\nestimate of when the future expenditures will be incurred and when the reserves\\nwill be produced.\\n\\nThe information provided does not represent management\\'s estimate of the\\ncompany\\'s expected future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves.\\nEstimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new\\ninformation becomes available. Moreover, probable and possible reserves, which\\nmay become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The\\narbitrary valuation prescribed under SFAS 69 requires assumptions as to the\\ntiming and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations\\nare made as of December 31 each year and should not be relied upon as an\\nindication of the company\\'s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas\\nreserves.\\n\\n                                    FS-33\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nTABLE V -STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO\\nPROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES -

One of the\\ncontract areas is dedicated to geothermal reserves.  Geothermal proved \\nreserves in Darajat, West Java, are able to supply a 100 megawatt power\\ngenerating plant for over 30 years.  Production of steam generation during\\n1995 was 368,219,927 KWH, with 55 megawatts being sold under a 30 year energy\\ncontract and 70 megawatts of electrical power generation being developed for\\nsale.  A joint operating agreement is being developed with a new Indonesian\\npartner to carry out geothermal business interests.  At year end, AOPL had\\nabout 275 employees, of which about 6% were located in the United States.\\n\\nEnvironmental Activities\\n- ------------------------\\n\\nThe Group\\'s activities are subject to environmental, health and safety\\nregulations in each of the countries in which it operates.  Such regulations\\nvary significantly in degree of scope, standards and enforcement.  The Group\\'s\\npolicy is to comply with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws\\nand regulations.  The Group has an active program to ensure its environmental\\nstandards are maintained, which includes closely monitoring applicable\\nstatutory and regulatory requirements, as well as enforcement policies in each\\nof the countries in which it operates, and conducting periodic environmental\\ncompliance audits.  At December 31, 1995, the Group had accrued $21 million\\nfor various remediation activities.  The environmental guidelines and\\ndefinitions promulgated by the American Petroleum Institute provide the basis\\nfor reporting the Group\\'s expenditures.  For the year ended December 31, 1995,\\nthe Group, including its equity share of nonsubsidiary companies, incurred\\ncapital costs of $206 million and nonremediation related operating expenses of\\n$139 million. The major component of the Group\\'s expenditures is for the\\nprevention of air pollution. In addition, as of December 31, 1995, reserves\\nrelative to the future cost of restoring and abandoning existing oil and gas\\nproperties were $48 million. Based upon existing statutory and regulatory\\nrequirements, investment and operating plans and known exposures, the Group\\nbelieves environmental expenditures will not materially affect its liquidity,\\nfinancial position or results of operations.\\n\\n\\n                                   C-4\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n                       Independent Auditors\\' Report\\n                       ----------------------------\\n\\n\\nTO THE STOCKHOLDERS\\nTHE CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES:\\n\\nWe have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of the Caltex Group\\nof Companies as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related combined\\nstatements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for each of the years\\nin the three-year period ended December 31, 1995.

STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n(1)   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n\\n      PRINCIPLES OF COMBINATION\\n\\nThe combined financial statements of the Caltex Group of Companies(Group)\\ninclude the accounts of Caltex Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries,\\nAmerican Overseas Petroleum Limited and subsidiary and P.T. Caltex Pacific\\nIndonesia after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.\\nSubsidiaries include companies owned directly or indirectly more than 50\\npercent except cases in which control does not rest with the Group.\\n\\nA subsidiary of Chevron Corporation and two subsidiaries of Texaco Inc.\\n(stockholders) each own 50% of the outstanding common shares of the Group\\ncompanies.  The Group is primarily engaged in exploring, producing, refining\\nand marketing crude oil and refined products in the Eastern Hemisphere.  The\\nGroup employs accounting policies that are in accordance with generally\\naccepted accounting principles in the United States.\\n\\n      TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES\\n\\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all principal subsidiary\\noperations.  Nonsubsidiary companies in Japan and Korea use the local\\ncurrency as the functional currency.\\n\\n      ESTIMATES\\n\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally\\naccepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\\nreporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The\\nGroup believes that the effects of any such changes in the near term would\\nnot have a material impact on the financial statements.\\n\\n      INVENTORIES\\n\\nCrude oil and refined product inventories are stated at the lower of cost\\n(primarily determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method) or current\\nmarket value.  Costs include applicable purchase and refining costs, duties,\\nimport taxes, freight, etc.  Materials and supplies are valued at average\\ncost.\\n\\n      INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES\\n\\nInvestments in and advances to nonsubsidiary companies in which 20% to 50%\\nof the voting stock is owned by the Group, or in which the Group has the\\nability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for by the equity\\nmethod.  Under this method, the Group\\'s equity in the earnings or losses of\\nthese companies is included in current results, and the related investments\\nreflect the equity in the book value of underlying net assets.  Investments\\nin other nonsubsidiary companies are carried at cost and related dividends\\nare reported as income.\\n\\n      PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\\n\\nExploration and production activities are accounted for under the \"successful\\nefforts\" method.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses for\\ncapitalized costs relating to the producing area, including intangible\\ndevelopment costs, are computed using the unit-of-production method.\\n\\n\\n                                   C-10\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                        CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                  NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n(1)   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED\\n\\nAll other assets are depreciated by class on a uniform straight-line basis.\\nDepreciation rates are based upon the estimated useful life of each class of\\nproperty. \\n\\nMaintenance and repairs necessary to maintain facilities in operating\\ncondition are charged to income as incurred.  Additions and betterments that\\nmaterially extend the life of properties are capitalized.  Upon disposal of\\nproperties, any net gain or loss is included in other income.\\n\\n      DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\n\\nGains and losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are included\\nin the carrying amounts of those assets and liabilities and are ultimately\\nrecognized in income as part of those carrying amounts.  Gains and losses\\nrelated to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions\\nalso are deferred and are recognized in income or as adjustments of carrying\\namounts when the underlying hedged transaction occurs. If, subsequent to\\nbeing hedged, underlying transactions are no longer likely to occur, the\\nrelated derivatives\\' gains and losses are recognized currently in income.\\n\\n      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\\n\\nCompliance with environmental regulations is determined in consideration of\\nthe existing laws in each of the countries in which the Group operates and\\nthe Group\\'s own internal standards.  The Group capitalizes expenditures that\\ncreate future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation. Remediation\\ncosts are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposure even if\\nuncertainties exist about the ultimate cost of the remediation.  Such accruals\\nare based on the best available nondiscounted estimated costs using data\\ndeveloped by third party experts.  Costs of environmental compliance for past\\nand ongoing operations, including maintenance and monitoring, are expensed as\\nincurred.  Recoveries from third parties are recorded as assets when\\nrealizable.\\n\\n      RECLASSIFICATIONS\\n\\nCertain amounts have been reclassified for preceding periods to conform with\\nthe current year\\'s presentation.\\n\\n\\n(2)   CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\\n\\nThe Group adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,\\n\"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities\" effective\\nJanuary 1, 1994.  SFAS No. 115 requires that investments in equity securities\\nthat have readily determinable fair values and all investments in debt\\nsecurities be classified into three categories based on management\\'s intent.\\nSuch investments are to be reported at fair value except for debt securities\\nintended to be held to maturity which are to be reported at amortized cost.\\nPreviously, all such investments were accounted for at amortized cost.  The\\ncumulative effect of this change at January 1, 1994 was an increase in\\nstockholders\\' equity of $70 million, after related taxes, representing\\nunrealized net gains applicable to securities categorized as available-for-\\nsale under the new standard. Such securities are primarily held by\\nnonsubsidiary companies accounted for by the equity method.\\n\\nEffective October 1, 1995, the Group adopted SFAS No. 121, \"Accounting for the\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.\"\\nSFAS No. 121 establishes guidelines for recognizing and measuring impairment\\nof long-lived assets.  Adoption of this standard did not impact the combined\\nfinancial statements of the Group.\\n\\n\\n                                   C-11\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                        CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                 NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)   INVENTORIES\\n\\nThe excess of current cost over the stated value of inventory maintained on\\nthe LIFO basis was approximately $52 million and $56 million at December 31,\\n1995 and 1994, respectively. \\n\\nDuring 1995, 1994 and 1993, inventory quantities maintained on the LIFO basis\\nwere reduced at certain locations.  The inventory reductions, net of market\\nvaluation adjustments, resulted in a decrease in the earnings of consolidated\\nsubsidiaries and nonsubsidiary companies at equity of approximately $1 million\\nand $8 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively, and an increase of $1 million\\nin 1993.\\n\\nCharges of $104 million reduced income in 1993 to reflect a market value of\\ncertain inventories lower than their LIFO carrying value.  Earnings of $25\\nmillion and $30 million, net of inventory reduction effects, were recorded in\\n1995 and 1994, respectively, to reflect a partial recovery of prior year\\ncharges.\\n\\n\\n(4)   NONSUBSIDIARY COMPANIES AT EQUITY\\n\\nInvestments in and advances to nonsubsidiary companies at equity at\\nDecember 31 include the following (in millions):\\n\\n                                                Equity Share   1995   1994\\n                                                ------------ ------ ------\\n   Nippon Petroleum Refining Company, Limited      50%       $1,132 $  997\\n   Koa Oil Company, Limited                        50%          427    448\\n   Honam Oil Refinery Company, Limited             50%          762    557\\n   Australian Petroleum Pty.

Limited (APPL) which\\nowns and manages the combined refining and marketing operations.  CAL\\ncontributed net assets with a carrying value of $419 million for its 50%\\nequity interest in APPL.  CAL\\'s petroleum refining and marketing net assets\\nwere contributed at their historical basis, and no gain or loss was recognized\\non the transaction.  The carrying value of CAL\\'s investment in APPL exceeds\\nits proportionate share of APPL\\'s net equity.  The excess will be amortized\\nover a period of 20 years.\\n\\nThe remaining interest in Star Petroleum Refining Company, Ltd. (SPRC) is\\nowned by a Thailand governmental entity.  Due to provisions in the SPRC\\nshareholder agreement, control over SPRC does not rest with the Group.  In\\naddition, the Group\\'s degree of ownership is temporary.  The SPRC construction\\nand operation agreement between the government\\'s Ministry of Industry and the\\nGroup stipulates that the Group must reduce its interest in SPRC to a minority\\nshare by the year 2000.\\n\\n\\n                                   C-12\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                        CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                 NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n(4)   NONSUBSIDIARY COMPANIES AT EQUITY - CONTINUED\\n\\nShown below is summarized combined financial information for these\\nnonsubsidiary companies (in millions):\\n\\n                                  100%                  Equity Share\\n                             ---------------           -----------------\\n                              1995     1994             1995       1994\\n                             ------   ------           ------     ------\\n      Current assets         $7,125   $5,352           $3,556     $2,651\\n      Other assets           10,415    7,821            5,368      3,858\\n\\n      Current liabilities     5,608    4,940            2,804      2,363\\n      Other liabilities       5,865    3,504            3,039      1,776\\n\\n      Net worth               6,067    4,729            3,081      2,370\\n\\n\\n                                   100%                   Equity Share\\n                      ---------------------------  ---------------------------\\n                        1995      1994      1993     1995      1994      1993\\n                      -------   -------   -------  -------   -------   -------\\n   Operating revenues $15,396   $10,886   $10,679   $7,674    $5,418    $5,304\\n   Operating income       955       770       494      472       381       242\\n   Net income             859       526       281      425       263       140\\n\\nDuring 1995, a nonsubsidiary company of the Group sold certain property\\nrequired by a local government.

After removal to Federal District Court\\nin Houston, the litigation\\'s disposition turned on questions of federal court\\njurisdiction and whether the case should be dismissed for forum non\\nconveniens. The plaintiffs\\' petition purported to be a class action on behalf\\nof at least 3,350 parties, who were either survivors of, or next of kin of\\npersons deceased in a collision in Philippine waters on December 20, 1987. One\\nvessel involved in the collision was carrying Group products in connection\\nwith a freight contract.  Although the Group had no direct or indirect\\nownership in or operational responsibility for either vessel, various theories\\nof liability were alleged against the Group.  No specific monetary recovery\\nwas sought although the petition contained a variety of demands for various\\ncategories of compensatory as well as punitive damages.  Consequently, no\\nreasonable estimate of damages involved or being sought can be made.  These\\nissues were resolved in the Group\\'s favor by the Federal District Court in\\nMarch 1992, through a forum non conveniens dismissal.  Subsequent to that\\ndismissal, but consistent with its terms, cases were filed against the Group\\nentities in the Philippine courts (over and above those previously filed there\\nsubsequent to the collision, all of which are in various stages of litigation\\nand are being vigorously resisted).  However, and notwithstanding the Houston\\nFederal District Court dismissal, the plaintiffs filed another lawsuit,\\nalleging the same causes of action as in the Texas litigation, in Louisiana\\nState Court in New Orleans. The Group removed that case to Federal District\\nCourt in New Orleans from which it was remanded back to Louisiana State Court.\\nThe Group then sought injunctive and other relief from the Federal District\\nCourt in Houston in order to ensure that Court\\'s previous dismissal would be\\ngiven proper effect.  On having its request for relief denied, the Group then\\nfiled an expedited appeal to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That\\ncourt, in January of 1996, affirmed the Federal District Court\\'s refusal to\\nenjoin the plaintiffs\\' proceeding with their Louisiana lawsuit.  The Group has\\nfiled requests for rehearing with the Fifth Circuit three judge panel which\\nheard the case and, additionally, for en banc consideration of the case by the\\nentire Fifth Circuit. Management is contesting this case vigorously.\\n\\nThe Group may be subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental\\nlaws and regulations in each of the countries in which it operates that, in\\nthe future, may require the Group to take action to correct or remediate the\\neffects on the environment of prior disposal or release of petroleum\\nsubstances by the Group.  The amount of such future cost is indeterminable due\\nto such factors as the nature of the new regulations, the unknown magnitude of\\nany possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective\\nactions that may be required, and the extent to which such costs are\\nrecoverable from third party insurance.\\n\\nThe Group is also involved in certain other litigation and Internal Revenue\\nService tax audits that could involve significant payments if such items are\\nall ultimately resolved adversely to the Group.\\n\\n\\n                                   C-16\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                        CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                   NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n(9)   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - CONTINUED\\n\\nWhile it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability\\nwith respect to the above mentioned and other contingent liabilities, the\\naggregate amount that may arise from such liabilities is not anticipated to be\\nmaterial in relation to the Group\\'s combined financial position, results of\\noperations, or liquidity.\\n\\nUnconditional purchase obligations in 1993 were not considered material.\\nHowever, in April 1994, a Group subsidiary entered into a contractual\\ncommitment, effective October 1996, for a period of eleven years, to purchase\\nrefined products in conjunction with the financing of a refinery that is\\npresently under construction by a nonsubsidiary company.  Total future\\nestimated commitments (in billions) for the Group under this and other similar\\ncontracts, based on current pricing and projected growth rates, are: 1996 -\\n $1.1, 1997 - $1.1, 1998 - $1.2, 1999 - $1.3, 2000 - $1.3, and 2001 to\\nexpiration of contracts - $6.1.  Purchases (in billions) under similar\\ncontracts were $.5, $.5, and $.6 in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.\\n\\n\\n(10)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\n\\nCertain Group companies are parties to financial instruments with off-balance\\nsheet credit and market risk, principally interest rate risk.  As of December\\n31, the Group had commitments outstanding for interest rate swaps and foreign\\ncurrency transactions for which the notional or contractual amounts are as\\nfollows (in millions):\\n\\n                                                          1995         1994\\n                                                        --------     --------\\n    Interest rate swaps - Pay Fixed, Receive Floating     $  485        $ 363  \\n    Interest rate swaps - Pay Floating, Receive Fixed     $  230        $ 182  \\n    Commitments to purchase foreign currencies            $  439        $ 252  \\n    Commitments to sell foreign currencies                $2,001        $ 274  \\n\\nThe Group enters into interest rate swaps in managing its interest rate risk,\\nand their effects are recognized in the statement of income at the same time\\nas the interest expense on the debt to which they relate.  The swap contracts\\nhave remaining maturities up to ten years.  Unrealized gains and losses on\\ncontracts outstanding at year-end 1995 and 1994 were not material.\\n\\nThe Group enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge against some of its\\nforeign currency exposure stemming from existing liabilities and firm\\ncommitments.  Forward exchange contracts hedging existing liabilities have\\nmaturities of up to seven years, and those contracts hedging firm commitments\\nhave maturities of under a year.  Contracts at December 31, 1995 primarily\\nreflect a hedge of the agreed proceeds of 200 billion Yen (approximately $2\\nbillion) from the April 1, 1996 sale of the Group\\'s interest in Nippon\\nPetroleum Refining Company, Limited, a nonsubsidiary.  As of December 31,\\n1995, the estimated unrealized exchange gain on this hedge is $42 million.\\nUnrealized gains and losses applicable to the remaining forward exchange\\ncontracts at December 31, 1995 and to the contracts at December 31, 1994 were\\nimmaterial since the forward rates approximated year-end spot rates.\\n\\nThe Group\\'s activity in commodity-based derivative contracts, that must be\\nsettled in cash, is not material. Unrealized gains and losses on commodity-\\nbased derivative contracts outstanding at year-end 1995 and 1994 were not\\nmaterial.\\n\\n\\n                                  C-17\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                        CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                 NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n(10)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CONTINUED\\n\\nThe Group\\'s long-term debt of $628 million and $715 million at December 31,\\n1995 and 1994, respectively, had fair values of $639 million and $707 million\\nat December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The fair value estimates were\\nbased on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at current market\\nrates for similar obligations.  The reported amounts of financial instruments\\nsuch as cash and cash equivalents, notes and accounts receivable, and all\\ncurrent liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturity.\\n\\nThe Group had investments in debt securities available-for-sale at amortized\\ncosts of $65 million and $63 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994,\\nrespectively, and investments in debt securities held to maturity at amortized\\ncosts of $14 million and $77 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994,\\nrespectively.  The fair value of these securities at December 31, 1995 and\\n1994 approximates amortized costs.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, investments\\nin debt securities available-for-sale had maturities less than ten years and\\ninvestments in debt securities held to maturity had maturities less than one\\nyear.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Group\\'s carrying amount for\\ninvestments in nonsubsidiary companies accounted for at equity included $65\\nmillion and $83 million, respectively, for net-of-tax unrealized net gains on\\ninvestments held by these nonsubsidiaries.\\n\\nThe Group had commitments of $12 million and $99 million at December 31,\\n1995 and 1994, respectively, in the form of letters of credit which have been\\nissued on behalf of Group companies to facilitate either the Group\\'s or other\\nparties\\' ability to trade in the normal course of business.  In addition, the\\nGroup is contingently liable at December 31, 1995, for a maximum of $192\\nmillion, for precompletion sponsor support of project finance obligations of a\\nnonsubsidiary.  Considering the status of the construction at December 31,\\n1995, the need for precompletion sponsor support is unlikely.  The Group will\\nbecome contingently liable for post-completion support of these project\\nfinance obligations when the nonsubsidiary has met certain plant physical\\ncompletion requirements.\\n\\nThe Group is exposed to credit risks in the event of non-performance by\\ncounterparties to financial instruments.  For financial instruments with\\ninstitutions, the Group does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet their\\nobligations given their high credit ratings.  Other financial instruments\\nexposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. These\\nreceivables are  dispersed among the countries in which the Group operates,\\nthus limiting concentrations of such risk.\\n\\nThe Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally\\ndoes not require collateral.

BUSINESS\\n\\n  (a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS\\n\\nSUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON\\n------------------------------\\nChevron Corporation (1), a Delaware corporation, is a major international oil\\ncompany. It provides administrative, financial and management support for, and\\nmanages its investments in, domestic and foreign subsidiaries and affiliates,\\nwhich engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemical operations,\\nreal estate development and other mineral and energy related activities in the\\nUnited States and approximately 100 other countries. Petroleum operations\\nconsist of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas;\\ntransporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipelines,\\nmarine vessels and motor equipment; refining crude oil into finished petroleum\\nproducts; and marketing crude oil, natural gas and the many products derived\\nfrom petroleum. Chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing of a\\nwide range of chemicals for industrial uses.\\n\\nIncorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the\\ncompany adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984. Domestic integrated\\npetroleum operations are conducted primarily through three divisions of the\\ncompany\\'s wholly owned Chevron U.S.A. Inc. subsidiary. Exploration and\\nproduction (\"upstream\") operations in the United States are carried out\\nthrough Chevron U.S.A. Production Company. U.S. refining and marketing\\n(\"downstream\") activities are performed by Chevron U.S.A. Products Company.\\nWarren Petroleum Company engages in all phases of the domestic natural gas\\nliquids business. A list of the company\\'s major subsidiaries is presented on\\npage EX-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 1994, Chevron\\nhad 45,758 employees, 77 percent of whom were employed in U.S. operations.\\n\\nOVERVIEW OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY\\n------------------------------\\nPetroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by a large\\nnumber of factors, over some of which individual oil and gas companies have\\nlittle control. Governmental attitudes and policies, particularly in the areas\\nof taxation, energy and the environment, have a significant impact on\\npetroleum activities, regulating where and how companies conduct their\\noperations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limiting their\\nprofits directly. Prices for crude oil and natural gas, petroleum products and\\npetrochemicals are determined by supply and demand for these commodities. OPEC\\nmember countries are the world\\'s swing producers of crude oil and their\\nproduction levels are the primary driver in determining worldwide supply.\\nDemand for crude oil and its products and natural gas is largely driven by the\\nhealth of local, national and worldwide economies, although weather patterns\\nand taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part.\\nNatural gas is generally produced and consumed on a country or regional basis.\\nIts largest use is for electrical generation, where it competes with other\\nenergy fuels.\\n\\nCURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\\n-----------------------------\\nAfter starting the year at a five-year low, crude oil prices rebounded in the\\nsecond quarter of 1994 on news of OPEC\\'s decision at their March 1994 meeting\\nto hold production at their current level of 24.5 million barrels per day for\\nthe balance of the year (subsequently extended through 1995) and concern of\\nsupply disruptions due to local disturbances in Nigeria. Crude oil prices\\nbegan to fall in August and continued to trend downward through the end of the\\nyear due to ample crude supplies, settlement of the Nigerian oil \\n\\n------------------\\n(1)  As used in this report, the term \"Chevron\" and such terms as \"the\\n     company,\" \"the corporation,\" \"our,\" \"we,\" and \"us\" may refer to Chevron\\n     Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or to all of\\n     them taken as a whole, but unless the context clearly indicates\\n     otherwise, should not be read to include \"affiliates\" of Chevron (those\\n     companies owned approximately 50 percent or less).\\n\\n     As used in this report, the term \"Caltex\" may refer to the Caltex Group\\n     of companies, any one company of the group, any of their consolidated\\n     subsidiaries, or to all of them taken as a whole and also includes the\\n     \"affiliates\" of Caltex.\\n\\n     All of these terms are used for convenience only, and are not intended as\\n     a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which\\n     manages its own affairs.\\n\\n                                   - 1 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nworker\\'s strike in early September and an abnormally mild winter in most parts\\nof the United States. The company\\'s U.S. realizations declined 72 cents per\\nbarrel from the previous year, representing the fourth consecutive year\\naverage realizations have fallen.\\n\\nU.S. natural gas prices also trended downward throughout 1994 after having\\nposted increases in the prior three years. Factors contributing to the\\ndecrease in natural gas prices included poor utility demand driven by the\\nrelatively mild summer and winter weather in many parts of the U.S., increased\\nCanadian gas exports to the U.S., high gas storage levels and improved\\nperformance of nuclear power plants that experienced downtime in the previous\\nyear. In the United States, the Henry Hub, Louisiana spot price for natural\\ngas, a common benchmark for natural gas prices, averaged $1.86 per thousand\\ncubic feet (MCF) in 1994, a decrease of $.25 per MCF from 1993.\\n\\nThe company\\'s average realization from U.S. crude oil production declined from\\n$14.58 per barrel in 1993 to $13.86 per barrel in 1994 while average liquids\\nrealizations from international liftings, including equity affiliates,\\ndeclined by $1.23 per barrel to $14.86 per barrel. Average U.S. natural gas\\nrealizations from production decreased to $1.77 per MCF in 1994 from $1.99 per\\nMCF in 1993.\\n\\nThe following table compares the high, low and average Chevron posted prices\\nfor West Texas Intermediate (WTI), an industry benchmark light crude oil, for\\neach of the quarters during 1994 and for the full years of 1994, 1993, and\\n1992:\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                     WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE CRUDE OIL\\n                           CHEVRON POSTED PRICES\\n                           (Dollars per Barrel)\\n\\n                         1994\\n         -------------------------------------\\n         1ST Q   2ND Q   3RD Q   4TH Q    YEAR    1993    1992\\n         -----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----\\nHigh     15.00   19.75   19.50   18.00   19.75   20.25   21.75\\nLow      13.00   13.75   15.75   15.75   13.00   13.00   16.50\\nAverage  13.80   16.71   17.48   16.68   16.18   17.68   19.71\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFor the first two months of 1995, average natural gas realizations for the\\ncompany\\'s U.S. operations were $1.43 per MCF. During this period, the\\ncompany\\'s posted price for WTI ranged from $16.50 per barrel to $18.00, with\\nan average of $17.28. On March 20, 1995 the company\\'s posted price for WTI was\\n$17.50 per barrel.\\n\\nChevron\\'s refining and marketing operations in the United States were\\nadversely affected by scheduled and unscheduled refinery downtime and other\\nrefinery operating problems in the first half of 1994. These refinery problems\\nincreased the company\\'s operating costs and caused the company to purchase\\nmore costly third-party products to supply the company\\'s marketing system.\\nThis put additional pressure on the company\\'s sales margins on refined\\nproducts which were already depressed most of the year due to ample supplies\\nin the marketplace. The company\\'s average sales price per barrel of refined\\nproduct declined for the fourth year in a row, falling to $24.37 per barrel in\\n1994 from $25.35 per barrel in 1993.\\n\\nThe company\\'s chemical operations improved significantly in 1994 as improving\\nworldwide economies, including the U.S., reduced industry overcapacity,\\nresulting in higher sales volumes and stronger prices for the company\\'s\\ncommodity chemicals. Sales and other operating revenues from the company\\'s\\nchemical operations, including sales to other Chevron companies, increased\\n$431 million from the $3,296 million recorded in 1993.\\n\\n                                   - 2 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nCHEVRON STRATEGIC DIRECTION\\n---------------------------\\nTo improve financial performance and to compete more effectively, Chevron\\ndeveloped and implemented seven \"strategic intents\" in 1992 and added an\\neighth \"strategic intent\" in 1993. The company periodically reviews and\\nmodifies these \"strategic intents\" to reflect Chevron\\'s current operating\\nenvironment. The eight \"strategic intents\" for 1995 are:\\n\\n-    BUILD A COMMITTED TEAM TO ACCOMPLISH THE CORPORATE MISSION.  The company\\n     continues to believe the success of the other seven strategic intents is\\n     dependent on the commitment and dedication that Chevron employees bring\\n     to their jobs. For the past three years, Chevron has measured employees\\'\\n     attitudes about the company and diagnosed areas of employee concerns by\\n     the use of the Worldwide Employee Survey. Due in large part to employee\\n     responses to the surveys, the company has recently developed or revamped\\n     programs in the areas of skills development, job selection, and upward\\n     feedback, a process in which employees are given the opportunity to\\n     evaluate their immediate supervisor. In 1994, the company sought to\\n     articulate this \"strategic intent\" by issuing a vision statement that\\n     outlined the attributes of a committed team. Underlying the vision\\n     statement was the need to promote trust, respect, support and teamwork\\n     among and between its employees and supervisors. The company is\\n     encouraging informed risk taking and encouraging employees to take an\\n     active role in planning and decision making while also increasing their\\n     accountability. Due in part to this \"strategic intent,\" a greater number\\n     of cross-functional teams are being formed in the company to make\\n     decisions and manage projects, demonstrating a greater amount of teamwork\\n     and cooperation among its employees. In January 1995, the company\\n     announced a new program that will provide employees with a cash bonus if\\n     the company achieves certain financial goals. In 1995 the program, called\\n     \"Chevron Success Sharing,\" will be based on Chevron\\'s adjusted Return on\\n     Capital Employed (ROCE). If the company achieves an ROCE of 10 percent or\\n     greater and its ROCE is among the top four of its major U.S. competitors,\\n     a cash bonus, varying from two to eight percent of an employee\\'s annual\\n     salary depending on the company\\'s relative ROCE ranking, will be paid to\\n     employees eligible to participate in the program.\\n\\n-    FOCUS ON REDUCING COSTS ACROSS ALL ACTIVITIES.  Operating expenses,\\n     adjusted for special items, declined $150 million in 1994 when compared\\n     to 1993, sustaining the prior year\\'s cost reductions as well as\\n     offsetting inflation and mitigating expenses associated with refinery\\n     problems in the first half of 1994. When compared to 1991, the base\\n     measurement year established when Chevron undertook an extensive\\n     cost-cutting and work force reduction program in early 1992, operating\\n     expenses in 1994 have declined by over $1 billion. Although a portion of\\n     the cost reduction is related to discontinued operations, the company\\n     believes the majority is the result of a permanent reduction in the\\n     company\\'s ongoing cost structure.\\n\\n     The company remains committed to further reductions in operating expense\\n     in 1995. Four \"breakthrough\" initiatives are currently in various stages\\n     of study or implementation that could result in large, permanent cost\\n     savings. These four \"breakthrough\" initiatives involve ways to reduce\\n     corporate energy costs; ways to reduce the cost of goods and services by\\n     working more efficiently with fewer suppliers; improvements to the\\n     project management process which is used to evaluate and administer large\\n     capital projects; and improvements in inventory management in order to\\n     avoid tying up working capital in excessive inventories.\\n\\n-    CONTINUE UPSTREAM GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL AREAS.  The company continues\\n     to believe opportunities to discover and develop major new reserves in\\n     the United States are limited due to regulatory barriers and drilling\\n     prohibitions on many of the most promising areas of development. In 1994,\\n     international exploration and production (E&P) capital spending rose 3\\n     percent to approximately 71 percent of total E&P capital spending,\\n     including affiliates. This same ratio of international versus total E&P\\n     spending is expected to continue in 1995. As recently as 1990, U.S.\\n     exploration and production capital spending was approximately 50 percent\\n     of the total. Since 1991, international oil and gas production has\\n     increased nearly 25 percent and oil and gas reserves have increased 80\\n     percent.\\n\\n                                   - 3 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n-    GENERATE GREATER THAN $800 MILLION IN CASH PER YEAR FROM U.S. UPSTREAM. \\n     Chevron is emphasizing a steady cash flow from a core group of\\n     approximately 400 oil and gas fields concentrated in California, Texas,\\n     the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico. Net cash flow after capital\\n     and exploratory expenditures for U.S. exploration and production\\n     operations fell to $750 million in 1994 from $1.2 billion in 1993 due to\\n     weak crude oil and natural gas prices throughout most of the year.\\n\\n     The company modified this \"strategic intent\" in 1995 by lowering the\\n     annual cash generation amount from $1 billion to $800 million. This\\n     modification reflects the significant change in the outlook for both\\n     crude and U.S. natural gas prices since the original \"strategic intent\"\\n     was set in 1991 combined with the progress achieved in cost reduction.\\n \\n     The company continues to evaluate its current properties as well as\\n     evaluate and acquire new properties that the company believes will help\\n     it meet and sustain its cash generation goal. In 1994, the company\\n     acquired certain gas properties in West Texas by purchasing 100 percent\\n     of the stock of Pakenham, Inc., a subsidiary of Wes-Tex Drilling Company.\\n     The company believes these properties hold considerable development\\n     potential. Over the next five years, Chevron plans to drill about 150\\n     wells on these properties at a cost of approximately $100 million and\\n     expects production to triple to 90 million cubic feet per day by 1999.\\n\\n-    ACHIEVE TOP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN U.S. DOWNSTREAM.  Chevron is seeking\\n     to strengthen its competitive position by investing in core refineries,\\n     reducing the size of its refining system and concentrating on specific\\n     marketing regions. The company sold its Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,\\n     refinery to Sun Company, Inc. in August 1994 and its Port Arthur, Texas,\\n     refinery to Clark Refining and Marketing, Inc. in February 1995. These\\n     refineries no longer fit Chevron\\'s plan to have a more focused U.S.\\n     refining operation and their sales eliminated large capital expenditures\\n     that would otherwise have been required to make the refineries more\\n     competitive and to meet the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\\n\\n-    GROW CALTEX IN ATTRACTIVE MARKETS WHILE ACHIEVING SUPERIOR COMPETITIVE\\n     FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  Management believes that the demand for petroleum\\n     products will continue to grow in the Asia Pacific region. Chevron\\'s 50\\n     percent owned Caltex affiliate, a leading competitor in these areas, has\\n     and is continuing to make significant capital investments to expand and\\n     upgrade its refining capacity and its retail marketing systems. Refinery\\n     upgrade projects are continuing in Singapore and Korea, as well as the\\n     construction of a new refinery in Thailand. In 1994, Caltex opened\\n     representative offices in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi to develop and\\n     evaluate business opportunities in Vietnam. In China, Caltex is exploring\\n     technical and commercial aspects of developing a business relationship\\n     with Sinopec\\'s Nanjing Refinery operated by Jinling Petrochemical\\n     Corporation. Caltex is also studying the feasibility of a joint venture\\n     with Shantou Ocean Enterprises to build a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)\\n     terminal in Shantou, China.\\n\\n-    IMPROVE COMPETITIVE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN CHEMICALS WHILE DEVELOPING\\n     ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH.  Financial results for the company\\'s\\n     chemical operations improved significantly in 1994 as the chemical\\n     industry in general rebounded from a period of depressed earnings due to\\n     sluggish world economies and production overcapacity. Improving world\\n     economies resulted in increased demand for the company\\'s commodity\\n     chemicals, which are used to package or manufacture numerous consumer\\n     goods. In addition, the company believes the restructuring and cost\\n     reduction plans that have been implemented in recent years positioned the\\n     company to take advantage of the improved industry conditions. In 1995,\\n     the company plans to continue its restructuring with the closing of its\\n     nitric acid and fertilizer plants in Richmond, California, while also\\n     investing in areas demonstrating growth potential. Chevron plans to\\n     invest about $200 million in its chemical operations in 1995, including\\n     plans to expand production capacity by 65 percent at its linear low\\n     density polyethylene (LLDPE) plant at Cedar Bayou, Texas. This expansion\\n     is expected to be completed in 1996.\\n\\n                                   - 4 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n-    BE SELECTIVE IN NON-CORE BUSINESSES.  Chevron operates four units that\\n     are outside the corporation\\'s core focus. These four units are Chevron\\n     Canada Limited (CCL) and Gulf Oil Great Britain (GOGB) whose primary\\n     operations are the refining and marketing of petroleum products in Canada\\n     and the U.K., respectively, The Pittsburg & Midway Coal Mining Co. (P&M),\\n     operator of the company\\'s mineral interests, and Chevron Land and\\n     Development Co. (CL&D), manager of the company\\'s surplus fee production\\n     properties and other real estate operations in California. Chevron\\n     manages these four units for cash flow and profitability, and for growth\\n     when attractive opportunities exist. In 1994, GOGB expanded its service\\n     station network by approximately 7 percent to total about 500 service\\n     stations at year-end. P&M completed its planned sale of Chevron\\'s non-\\n     coal interests in 1994 with the sale of its 50 percent interest in the\\n     Stillwater platinum and palladium mine in Montana and its 52.5 percent\\n     interest in some zinc-lead prospects in Ireland. CL&D generated over $140\\n     million in sales of developed and undeveloped real estate properties in\\n     1994. \\n\\n     In 1994, Chevron continued to dispose of other marginally performing or\\n     non-strategic assets, including the aforementioned refinery sales and the\\n     company\\'s headquarters building located in San Francisco, California. Due\\n     to recent downsizing and restructuring of its operations, it was\\n     determined that employees currently located in the headquarters building\\n     could be accommodated in the company\\'s other two San Francisco office\\n     buildings. Relocation of employees is expected to occur over the next 5\\n     years.\\n\\n     The company is currently seeking prospective purchasers for its real\\n     estate development assets in California and is currently reviewing its\\n     oil and gas operations in western Canada.\\n \\n\\n     (b) INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION\\n\\nThe company\\'s primary business is its integrated petroleum operations.\\nSecondary operations include chemicals and minerals. The petroleum activities\\nof the company are widely distributed geographically, with major operations in\\nthe United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, Angola, Congo,\\nPapua New Guinea, China, Indonesia and Zaire. The company\\'s Caltex affiliate,\\nthrough its subsidiaries and affiliates, conducts exploration and production\\noperations in Indonesia and refining and marketing activities in the Eastern\\nHemisphere, with major operations in Japan, Korea, Australia, the Philippines,\\nThailand and South Africa. Tengizchevroil (TCO), a 50/50 joint venture with a\\nsubsidiary of the national oil company of the Republic of Kazakhstan conducts\\nproduction activities in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic.\\n\\nThe company\\'s and its affiliates\\' chemicals operations are concentrated in the\\nUnited States, but include operating facilities in France, Japan and Brazil.\\nThe company\\'s and its affiliates\\' principal minerals activities consist of\\ncoal operations in the United States.\\n\\nTabulations setting forth three years\\' identifiable assets, operating income,\\nsales and other operating revenues for the company\\'s three industry segments,\\nby United States and International geographic areas, may be found in Note 9 to\\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-22 of this Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K.\\n\\n\\n      (c) DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES\\n\\nThe petroleum industry is highly competitive in the United States and\\nthroughout most of the world. This industry also competes with other\\nindustries in supplying the energy needs of various types of consumers.\\n\\nThe company\\'s operations can be affected significantly by changing economic,\\nregulatory and political environments in the various countries, including the\\nUnited States, in which it operates. The company evaluates the economic and\\npolitical risk of initiating, maintaining or expanding operations in any\\ngeographical area.\\n\\n                                   - 5 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nIn the United States, environmental regulations and federal, state and local\\nactions and policies concerning economic development, energy and taxation may\\nhave a significant effect on the company\\'s operations.\\n\\nInternationally, the company continues to closely monitor the civil unrest in\\nAngola and the political uncertainty in Nigeria and Zaire and the possible\\nthreat these may pose to the company\\'s oil and gas exploration and production\\noperations and the safety of the company\\'s employees located in those\\ncountries.\\n\\nThe company attempts to avoid unnecessary involvement in partisan politics in\\nthe communities in which it operates but participates in the political process\\nto safeguard its assets and to ensure that the community benefits from its\\noperations and remains receptive to its continued presence.\\n\\nThe company utilizes various derivative instruments to manage its exposure to\\nprice risk stemming from its integrated petroleum activities. Some of the\\ninstruments may be settled by delivery of the underlying commodity, whereas\\nothers can only be settled by cash.

The\\npercentage increase was due solely to increased expenditures in international\\nE&P as U.S. E&P expenditures, as a percentage of total consolidated\\nexpenditures, remained relatively unchanged from 1993.  U.S. E&P expenditures\\nin 1994 included the company\\'s acquisition of certain natural gas operations\\nin West Texas. Major international E&P expenditures in 1994 included the\\nacquisition of exploration and development interests in the Republic of Congo\\nand exploration and development activities associated with the Alba Field in\\nthe U.K. North Sea, the North West Shelf Project in Australia, the Hibernia\\nProject offshore Newfoundland, the Duri Steamflood Project\\n\\n                                   - 6 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nin Indonesia, Areas B and C in Angola, the Niger Delta region in Nigeria and\\nthe Tengiz Project in Kazakhstan.

Consolidated expenditures in 1995 are expected to\\nremain relatively flat at $3.9 billion while affiliate expenditures are\\nexpected to increase 37 percent to $1.2 billion. Worldwide E&P expenditures\\nare expected to total $2.7 billion, of which approximately 70 percent will be\\nfor international projects such as the continued development of the Hibernia\\nField, expansion of the North West Shelf Project, enhanced recovery projects\\nin Indonesia, development of the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan, development of\\nthe Alba and Britannia fields in the North Sea, development of the N\\'Kossa and\\nKitina fields in Congo, and other development projects in West Africa.\\nWorldwide refining, marketing and transportation expenditures are estimated at\\n$1.9 billion, with U.S. expenditures of about $900 million. These U.S.\\nexpenditures are largely due to major capital programs to manufacture clean\\nfuels at the Richmond and El Segundo, California, refineries as mandated by\\nthe California Air Resources Board regulations. Major international refining\\nand marketing expenditures in 1995 include the continuation of refinery\\nconstruction and expansion/upgrade projects by the company\\'s Caltex affiliate\\nto meet growing product demand in the Pacific Rim areas. Chemical expenditures\\nare also expected to rise in 1995 due to planned expansion of the linear low-\\ndensity polyethylene manufacturing plant at the Cedar Bayou, Texas, chemical\\nfacility.\\n \\nThe actual expenditures for 1995 will depend on various conditions affecting\\nthe company\\'s operations, including crude oil prices, and may differ\\nsignificantly from the company\\'s forecast.\\n\\n    PETROLEUM - EXPLORATION\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the company\\'s net interests in productive and\\ndry exploratory wells completed in each of the last three years and the number\\nof exploratory wells drilling at December 31, 1994. \"Exploratory wells\"\\ninclude delineation wells, which are wells drilled to find a new reservoir in\\na field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir\\nor to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area. \"Wells drilling\"\\ninclude wells temporarily suspended.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                        EXPLORATORY WELL ACTIVITY\\n\\n                                               NET WELLS COMPLETED (1)\\n                  WELLS DRILLING      ---------------------------------------\\n                    AT 12/31/94           1994         1993          1992\\n                -------------------   -----------   ----------    -----------\\n                GROSS (2)   NET (2)   PROD.

The company\\'s 1994 exploratory expenditures,\\nincluding affiliated companies\\' expenditures but excluding unproved property\\nacquisitions, were $526 million compared with $533 million in 1993. Domestic\\nexpenditures represented approximately 40 percent of the consolidated\\ncompanies\\' worldwide exploration expenditures, a 5 percent increase from the\\nprior year. Significant activities in Chevron\\'s exploration program during\\n1994 include the following (number of wells are on a \"gross\" basis):\\n\\nUNITED STATES: Domestic exploratory expenditures, excluding unproved property\\nacquisitions, were $209 million in 1994, compared to $183 million spent in\\n1993. In addition, the company incurred costs of $28 million for unproved\\nproperty acquisitions in 1994. The company continued to focus its exploratory\\nefforts in 1994 in the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, California, the Rocky Mountains\\nand in other areas where it has existing production. Twelve wildcat\\nexploratory wells were initiated in 1994 of which eleven were in new areas and\\none was in an existing core area. Including three wells commenced in late\\n1993, thirteen wells were completed in 1994, resulting in two discoveries in\\nthe Gulf of Mexico.  The company\\'s exploratory well in the Destin Dome Block\\n97, located 30 miles south of Pensacola, Florida in the Gulf of Mexico,\\nresulted in a dry hole. Exploration efforts in high-potential areas, including\\nAlaska\\'s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and parts of offshore Florida,\\nCalifornia and North Carolina have been blocked by legal restrictions and\\ndrilling moratoria. Chevron and other oil companies have sued the Department\\nof Interior to recover bonus payments, lease rentals and certain geophysical\\ncosts for federal offshore leases that remain undrilled due to state, federal,\\nand private objections to drilling. The company is seeking to recover\\napproximately $126 million, plus interest, spent on leases off Florida, North\\nCarolina and Alaska. Currently all parties have filed Motions for Summary\\nJudgment in this matter. Oral arguments were held on January 31, 1995 and a\\nruling is expected in 1995.\\n\\n                                   - 8 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nAFRICA: In Africa, the company spent $81 million during 1994 on exploratory\\nefforts, excluding the acquisition of unproved properties, compared with $104\\nmillion in 1993. The company also acquired $19 million of unproved properties\\nin 1994. \\n\\nIn Nigeria, the company\\'s operations are managed by three subsidiaries.\\nChevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) operates and holds a 40 percent interest in\\nconcessions totaling 2.3 million acres in the onshore and offshore regions of\\nthe Niger Delta. Chevron Oil Company (Nigeria) Limited (COCNL) holds a 20\\npercent interest in six concessions covering 600,000 acres with six oil fields\\noperated by a partner. Chevron Petroleum Nigeria Limited (CPNL) has a 30\\npercent interest in two deepwater Niger Delta blocks and three inland Benue\\nBasin blocks and an additional sole interest, through a production sharing\\ncontract signed in October 1994 with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company\\n(NNPC), in six other Benue Basin blocks. CNL drilled seven exploratory and\\nappraisal wells in 1994 which resulted in three new field discoveries, two\\nsuccessful appraisal wells and two dry holes. CNL also acquired 3-D seismic\\ndata covering Nigerian acreage of 200 square miles. COCNL, through its\\noperating partner, drilled one exploratory well in 1994 which discovered gas\\nand gas condensate. CPNL will begin seismic studies in 1995 as part of a work\\nprogram expected to span the next six years to explore for oil in six Benue\\nBasin blocks, totaling approximately 5,600 square miles. The company will\\nfinance the exploration phase and offset its cost from any future crude oil\\nproduction. This production sharing agreement is a departure from the joint\\nventure agreements of the past in which cost and revenue were shared according\\nto each party\\'s interest in the venture.\\n\\nIn Angola, the company is the operator of a 2,700 square mile concession off\\nthe coast of Angola\\'s Cabinda exclave. The concession is divided into Areas A,\\nB, and C, with Area A generating the majority of 1994 production. Area B\\nproduction commenced in November 1994 with the commissioning of installations\\nin the Kokongo Field. Chevron has a 39 percent interest in the concession. Six\\nexploratory wells were drilled in 1994, with three wells in Area A resulting\\nin oil discoveries. Two of these wells will be developed by drilling from\\nexisting facilities while the third well will be appraised in 1995 for the\\nappropriate installation facilities required for development. The other three\\nexploratory wells were drilled in Areas B and C and resulted in the\\ndiscoveries of the N\\'Sangui and Minzu fields. The current exploration license\\nfor Areas B and C expired in 1994. Negotiations are currently underway to\\nrenew this agreement for five additional years. In 1994, Chevron (operator\\nwith 31 percent interest) and its partners completed negotiations of a\\nProduction Sharing Agreement for Deepwater Block 14, located due west of Areas\\nB and C. The Angolan government approved the agreement in December 1994 and\\nsigning occurred in February 1995. A seismic program is scheduled to begin in\\nApril 1995 followed by the first of four exploration obligation wells in early\\n1996.\\n\\nOffshore Congo, Chevron currently participates in two production licenses and\\ntwo exploration licenses. The company has a 29 percent interest in the Kitina\\nproduction license and the Marine VII exploration license operated by AGIP.\\nBetween October 1994 and March 1995 Chevron acquired a 30 percent interest in\\nthe N\\'Kossa production license and the Haute Mer exploration license operated\\nby ELF Congo. The company and its partners plan to drill two wildcat wells in\\n1995, one in each of the two exploration areas. The company opened an office\\nin Congo in January 1995 to facilitate its participation in the two joint\\nventures.\\n\\nIn Zaire, the company has a 50 percent interest in, and is the operator of, a\\n390 square mile concession off the coast of Zaire. Exploration activity in\\n1994 resulted in an oil discovery in the Tshiala East exploration well. An\\nexisting production well was also deepened in 1994 and a new reservoir\\nunderlying Mibale Field was discovered. An exploration well in the Mibale\\nField and the Tshiala West #1 well commenced in December 1994.\\n\\nOTHER INTERNATIONAL INCLUDING AFFILIATED COMPANIES: Exploration expenditures,\\nexcluding unproved property acquisitions, were $236 million in 1994, a\\ndecrease of $10 million from the 1993 amount of $246 million. In addition,\\nunproved properties of $21 million were acquired in 1994.\\n\\nIn Europe, Chevron\\'s exploration efforts were concentrated in the U.K. sector\\nof the North Sea and off the coast of Wales where the company has conducted\\nresearch and a joint environmental appraisal of the coast in order to allay\\nlocal concern about the environmental impacts of exploration off the\\nPembrokeshire coast.\\n\\n                                   - 9 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nIn Ireland, the company converted three blocks in the Celtic Sea from seismic\\noptions to full exploration licenses in February 1995. In addition, the\\ncompany filed an application for blocks in the deep water area west of Ireland\\nduring the Porcupine Basin Licensing Round.\\n\\nIn Canada, exploration efforts in 1994 continued to be concentrated in the\\nwestern part of the country near existing infrastructures that would allow any\\nreserves to be brought on production quickly. A total of 26 exploratory wells\\nwere drilled in 1994, resulting in 2 oil and 6 gas discoveries.\\n\\nIn Australia, Chevron and its partners in West Australia Petroleum Pty., Ltd.\\n(WAPET) participated in two successful exploration wells resulting in an oil\\ndiscovery in the Crest 1 well and a gas discovery in the Chrysaor 1 well. Both\\ndiscoveries are located off the western coast of Australia. The company\\ncompleted its 3D seismic surveys over the northern part of the Barrow Island\\noil field and over the onshore Dongara gas/oil field in 1994. Permit WA-253-P,\\ncovering a 519,000 acre block north of Gorgon, was issued to WAPET on behalf\\nof Chevron (50 percent) and a partner during 1994. In December 1994, Chevron\\nsigned an agreement to farm-in to WA-215-P in the area between Barrow and\\nThevenard Island. A farm-in well will be drilled late in the first half of\\n1995. In addition, the company and its partners in the North West Shelf\\nProject continued their interpretative work on the East Dampier 3D seismic\\nsurvey. As a result of this work, two exploration wells will be drilled in\\n1995. In March 1995, the company announced that one of these wells, Perseus-1,\\nhad discovered a natural gas and condensate deposit in the waters off\\nnorthwest Australia, between the North Rankin and Goodwyn fields. The company\\nwithdrew from a permit it held with Shell in the Timor Sea in 1994.\\n\\nIn Papua New Guinea, Chevron and its partners\\' 1994 efforts were focused on\\nthe delineation of the Gobe Main oil field. In addition, two new exploratory\\nwells commenced in 1994: the SE Mananda 2X well extended a previous oil\\ndiscovery that may eventually be tied in with the Kutubu field\\'s production\\nand the TA-1X well was drilling at year-end on another prospect between the\\nGobe and Kutubu fields. In 1995, the company and its partners anticipate an\\nactive exploration program to follow up the prospect development work that was\\ncarried out in 1994. Exploratory efforts in 1995 are expected to focus on\\nuntested trends in the PPL-161 and PDL-2 licenses, where prospects with\\nKutubu-sized potential still remained to be tested. In the past, exploration\\nefforts have largely concentrated on a single trend which included the Kutubu\\nfields, the Gobe fields, and the SE Mananda discovery.\\n\\nIn China, Chevron completed seismic studies on Block 33/08 in the East China\\nSea in 1994. The company was awarded sole interest in this block in late 1993.\\nTwo exploratory wells are planned for 1995, the first of which commenced in\\nFebruary. This wildcat well, designated Wenzhou 15-1-1, reached its targeted\\ndepth and was plugged and abandoned. The second well is scheduled to commence\\nin late March 1995. A production sharing agreement, granting sole interest in\\nBlock 62/23 in the South China Sea, was signed by the company and the Chinese\\nNational Offshore Oil Company in late February 1995. A natural gas exploratory\\nwell is planned for this block in 1996. Exploration obligations for the\\ncurrent phase of Contract area 16/08 were fulfilled in 1994. Studies are\\nplanned in 1995 to determine the optimum program for the three marginal\\ndiscoveries in this Contract area.\\n\\nIn Bolivia, Chevron at year-end was negotiating the final terms of a farm out\\nof the Caipipendi Exploration Block which, if successful, will lead to a\\npartner funded seismic program over prospects in the southern half of the\\nblock.\\n\\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, the first of four exploratory wells, Rocky Palace #1,\\nwas drilled and tested in 1994. Iguana River #1, the second exploratory well,\\nwas drilled in 1994 but encountered mechanical problems and was unable to\\nreach the reservoir objectives. Ste.

Production\\nincreases were noted in a number of countries. In the U.K., production from\\nAlba Field, which went on stream in January 1994, and additional production\\nfrom Ninian Field, as a result of the company\\'s acquisition of an additional 6\\npercent equity interest in December 1993, caused U.K. production to increase\\n43 percent to 70,720 barrels of oil per day. Oil production in Africa\\nincreased 9 percent to 237,600 barrels per day primarily due to increased\\nNigerian production as a result of full year production from three fields\\nplaced on stream in late 1993, four new fields placed on stream in 1994 and\\nhigher production quotas in 1994, and Angolan production, which increased in\\n1994 due to new wells in the Takula, Numbi and N\\'Sano fields. Indonesian\\nproduction, including the company\\'s share of its affiliate\\'s production, rose\\n6 percent to\\n\\n                                   - 11 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n173,250 barrels per day in 1994 as a result of the application of enhanced\\nrecovery methods in certain fields. In Kazakhstan, Chevron\\'s net oil\\nproduction doubled to 22,630 barrels per day in 1994 due to full year\\nproduction and increased export quotas in the latter half of the year. These\\nproduction increases were partially offset by production declines in the\\nUnited States due to divestments of producing properties in late 1993,\\nprimarily Milne Point, and normal field declines.\\n\\nNet production of natural gas, including affiliates, increased 4 percent to\\n2,630,570 thousand cubic feet per day. Increases were noted in Australia due\\nto initial production from the Roller, Skate and Crest fields, in Canada as a\\nresult of reduced re-injection requirements and the shallow gas program, which\\nis designed to rapidly develop and produce gas from low-depth reserves, in the\\nU.S. due primarily to new wells in the Laredo area of Texas and one month\\'s\\nproduction from the Pakenham, Inc. acquisition, and in Kazakhstan due to full\\nyear production.\\n\\nThe natural gas industry is undergoing rapid and significant changes that have\\nsqueezed margins and caused markets to become more competitive. In the United\\nStates, natural gas producers have traditionally sold their production to\\npipeline companies, who in turn distribute the product to their customers. As\\na result of FERC Order 636, producers now can sell directly to customers and\\nprovide many of the services previously provided by the pipeline companies.\\nChevron has concentrated its natural gas marketing efforts on the longer term\\ncontract market. These customers, which include local distribution companies\\nand industrials, require premium bearing services and marketing arrangements\\nthat Chevron can fulfill. The company\\'s sales to these customers have risen\\nsignificantly, while sales to pipeline companies have correspondingly\\ndeclined. Chevron has recently completed a detailed evaluation of its existing\\nnatural gas marketing efforts and, as a result, will be dedicating additional\\nresources to the effort of marketing gas to targeted end-users. The company\\nhas developed and implemented a process that it believes will significantly\\nreduce the cycle time associated with identifying, piloting, and capitalizing\\non new natural gas marketing opportunities. This new process should allow the\\ncompany to more readily move natural gas out of mature, lower margin markets\\ninto emerging, high-growth premium markets. \\n\\nData on the company\\'s average sales price per unit of oil and gas produced, as\\nwell as the average production cost per unit for 1994, 1993, and 1992 are\\nreported in Table III on pages FS-32 and FS-33 of this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.

Additions to\\nproved reserves from acquisitions were approximately 1 million barrels of\\ncrude oil and natural gas liquids and 55 billion cubic feet of natural gas.\\n\\nChevron\\'s development of its wholly owned San Joaquin Valley diatomite\\nreserves in the Lost Hills Field in California continued with the drilling and\\ncompletion of 37 new wells and the reworking of 42 older wells using reservoir\\nfracturing techniques. A four year water injection project, initiated in 1992,\\nto sustain reservoir pressure and further boost production continued into its\\nthird year with the drilling of 39 injection wells and the conversion of 7\\nproducing wells to injection. When completed, the 520-acre project will have\\nover 200 injectors with a total injection rate of 40,000 barrels of water per\\nday. The combination of reservoir fracturing and water injection is expected\\nto significantly increase both the production rate and the amount of oil\\nultimately recoverable from this resource.\\n\\nChevron owns approximately 25 percent of the Point Arguello project, offshore\\nCalifornia, and operates two offshore platforms (Hermosa and Hidalgo), the\\nonshore Gaviota oil and gas plant and the interconnecting pipelines. Chevron\\nand its partners ceased double-hull tankering of oil from the project to the\\nLos Angeles area on February 1, 1994 in compliance with the terms of the\\ntankering permit granted by the California Coastal Commission. These terms\\nrequired suspension of tankering if Chevron and its partners were unable to\\nsign, by February 1, an agreement with a pipeline developer, who possessed the\\nnecessary discretionary permits needed for a new pipeline, that the developer\\ncould use for pipeline financing.\\n\\n                                   - 13 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nProduction from the project averaged 78,000 barrels of oil per day in 1994,\\nsomewhat below its full production capacity but at about the same level as\\nunder tankering. About a third of current production is delivered via pipeline\\nto Los Angeles area refineries. However, due to a shortage of adequate\\ntransportation facilities to Los Angeles, the balance of production is shipped\\nvia pipeline to markets in the Midwest, resulting in increased transportation\\ncosts. In March 1994, the company announced that an agreement had been reached\\nwith a pipeline developer to build a 130-mile pipeline in Southern California\\nthat would carry Point Arguello oil production to Los Angeles. Chevron and\\ncertain other project partners will have a minority interest in the pipeline.\\nThe pipeline project is currently in the environmental review stage and is\\nscheduled to be certified in October 1995. However, a property owner in the\\npipeline right of way is pushing for an alternate route, which may cause\\nfurther delays. If the environmental review is certified in October 1995, the\\nissuance of permits and the start of construction are expected in the first\\nquarter of 1996. A workover and drilling program, designed to add proved\\nreserves and abate the decline in production rate continued in 1994 with the\\ndrilling and completion of two new wells and one redrill during the year.\\n\\nIn 1994, Chevron completed an economic evaluation of the viability of\\ndeveloping the Green Canyon 205 Field located 2,600 feet below the ocean\\'s\\nsurface in the Gulf of Mexico. Preliminary field development plans have been\\nfinalized; however, alternative development concepts will be considered\\nthrough the first half of 1995, at which time a final selection will be made.\\nPreliminary engineering work is expected to begin in early 1995. Initial\\nproduction is planned for 1999 and is expected to exceed 50,000 barrels per\\nday. Chevron has a 67 percent interest in this field.\\n\\nThe drilling phase at the company\\'s Garden Banks 191 \"A\" platform in the Gulf\\nof Mexico was completed in late 1994. Natural gas production from this block\\nstarted in late 1993 and is currently producing at a daily rate of 200 million\\ncubic feet of gas, exceeding original production estimates of 150 million\\ncubic feet per day. Chevron is the operator and holds a 50 percent interest in\\nthis block.\\n\\nIn the Gulf of Mexico\\'s Norphlet gas trend, which stretches some 80 miles from\\nthe Destin Dome area (offshore Florida) to the Mobile Block 861 area (offshore\\nMississippi), production from the Mobile Block 861 #8 well commenced in\\nFebruary 1994. Production from three additional wells drilled in 1994 is\\nexpected to start in 1996 with the completion of a processing facility\\ncurrently being fabricated for the Mobile 861 Area. Production from three\\nwells in the Mobile Block 916 Area offshore Alabama is expected to come on\\nstream in April 1995 with a combined daily net rate of 50 million cubic feet\\nof gas. Chevron\\'s interest in various blocks in the Norphlet gas trend vary\\nfrom 33 percent to 100 percent.\\n\\nNine of thirty-six prospects identified using the 3-D seismic survey of the\\nEugene Island 238 Field in the Gulf of Mexico have been drilled by the end of\\n1994. Seven wells were successful, resulting in four gas and three oil\\ndiscoveries. A new production platform, added in 1994 to accommodate the oil\\ndiscoveries, will increase production by 9,000 barrels per day. Three\\nadditional wells will be drilled and an additional satellite platform will be\\ninstalled in 1995. By the end of 1995, daily total production for the field is\\nforecasted to exceed 200 million cubic feet of gas and 15,000 barrels of oil.\\nChevron has a 100 percent interest in this field except for Block 229, where\\nChevron\\'s interest is 70 percent.\\n\\nChevron continued to aggressively develop \"tight gas\" (gas which is produced\\nfrom a tight, low-permeability formation) in the Laredo, Texas area. In 1994,\\ntwenty-five wells were drilled, adding proved reserves of 176 billion cubic\\nfeet of gas. Current net production averaged 165 million cubic feet of gas per\\nday. The company acquired more than 12,000 new acres in 1994 for future\\ndevelopment. Chevron\\'s interest in the leases is 100 percent except for one\\nlease in which the company\\'s interest is 59 percent.\\n\\nIn 1994, the company purchased the stock of Pakenham, Inc., a subsidiary of\\nWes-Tex Drilling Company. Assets acquired in the purchase included 47 natural\\ngas producing wells in West Texas, 52 billion cubic feet of net proved natural\\ngas reserves and a gathering system that is currently used to transport\\nnatural gas to a pipeline owned by Valero Transmission Company. Warren\\nPetroleum Company, Chevron\\'s gas processing unit, is expanding its operations\\nto include the Pakenham gas gathering and processing business. The company\\nbelieves the field holds the potential to further increase the company\\'s gas\\nreserves and expects to add wells that will more than triple the current\\nproduction of 25 million cubic feet per day to 90 million cubic feet per day\\nby 1999.\\n\\n                                   - 14 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nAFRICA: Developmental expenditures in Africa were $276 million in 1994,\\ncompared to $239 million in 1993. Expenditures for proved reserve acquisitions\\namounted to $145 million in 1994. Additions to proved reserves from\\nextensions, discoveries and improved recovery, before revisions, were 103\\nmillion barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Additions to proved\\nreserves from acquisitions were approximately 76 million barrels of crude oil\\nand natural gas liquids. Acquisition expenditures and proved reserves from\\nacquisitions in 1994 were both primarily related to the company\\'s activities\\nin the Congo.\\n\\nIn Angola, where Chevron\\'s equity interest is 39 percent, 15 development wells\\nwere added in Area A fields in 1994. Production from the greater Takula Area\\nfields increased in 1994 due to ongoing development of the N\\'Sano and Numbi\\nSoutheast fields and from infill programs in existing reservoirs. A new\\nproduction platform and associated pipelines were installed in N\\'Sano Field\\nduring 1994 and development drilling commenced at mid-year. A decline in\\nproduction from the greater Malongo Area fields was reversed in 1994 through a\\ncombination of production from new exploration discoveries and continued\\ninfill activity. One offshore processing platform in the Malongo South Field\\nwas revamped and modernized in 1994. The company expects to maintain\\nproduction from Area A in future years through the combination of infill\\ndrilling, workovers, facility modernization, waterflood and gas injection.\\n\\nAreas B and C continued to be the major focus of 1994 development programs in\\nAngola with the installation of two integrated drilling and production\\nplatforms in the Kokongo Field in Area B. The East Kokongo platform is\\ndesigned as the hub for future phases of development for Areas B and C and\\nincludes a thirty-eight mile pipeline linking the platforms to onshore\\nterminal facilities in Malongo. Drilling rigs were installed in the fourth\\nquarter of 1994 which resulted in initial production being established in late\\nNovember. By year-end, two wells had been completed and additional drilling is\\nexpected to continue into 1996. The Nemba Field in Area B is expected to\\noperate as a satellite of East Kokongo. Contracts were awarded in 1994 for an\\nearly production system consisting of three subsea wells, a tanker for\\nfloating production service and related flowlines and pipelines. Production\\nstart-up is scheduled for the second half of 1995. Tenders were issued in 1994\\nfor the construction of additional Area B facilities, consisting of two\\nintegrated platforms and associated pipelines, related to the development of\\nLomba Field and the southern portion of Nemba Field. Start-up is forecasted\\nfor 1997 at which time the early production system at Nemba will be de-\\ncommissioned and the three subsea wells tied-back to Nemba South for continued\\nproduction. The Lomba installation will operate as a satellite of Nemba South.\\nContracts for the development of the Sanha and N\\'Dola fields in Area C were\\nreleased in the fourth quarter of 1994 following resolution of partner\\nfinancing issues. The development will consist of two integrated platforms and\\nrelated pipelines and facilities which are currently being fabricated in South\\nAfrica. These fields will act as satellites of East Kokongo with start-up\\nforecasted for early 1997.\\n\\nIn Nigeria, total production from the 26 CNL-operated fields averaged 369,200\\nbarrels of oil per day, an increase of over 41,000 barrels of oil per day from\\n1993. This increase was the result of new field development programs,\\ndevelopment drilling in existing fields, workover programs and increased\\ncommercial allowables. Four new fields, Abigborodo, Jokka, Kito and Benin\\nRiver, were placed on production in 1994. Benin River production commenced in\\nDecember 1994 from one well. Detailed engineering for the full development of\\nBenin River will continue in 1995 with full production start-up planned for\\n1996. The platform upgrade program marked its second year in 1994. This\\nprogram, intended to upgrade all existing platforms in order to extend the\\nuseful life and enhance the safety and environmental performance of these\\nfacilities, continued at Delta, Meren 1 and Okan fields. Engineering was\\ncompleted for Utonana and is underway for Abiteye, Makaraba, Isan/West Isan,\\nMalu and two satellite platforms at Okan. Work on the Escravos Gas Project,\\nPhase I, continued in 1994 with the completion of sand-filling at the onshore\\nsite for the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) extraction/fractionation plant. In\\naddition, 93 percent of the detailed design engineering work for Phase I of\\nthe project was completed in 1994. This first phase will utilize gas that is\\ncurrently being flared in the Okan and Mefa fields. The project will include\\noffshore gas compression facilities, an onshore LPG extraction plant, and a\\nfloating LPG storage unit anchored offshore. The project will sell gas under a\\nlong term contract to the Nigerian Gas Company in addition to producing\\napproximately 15,000 barrels per day of hydrocarbon liquids for export. Start-\\nup of the project is now expected in mid-1997.\\n\\n                                   - 15 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nIn the Congo, Chevron and its partners have begun developing the Kitina Field.\\nDevelopment consists of a drilling jacket with some topside facilities, tied\\nvia a pipeline to other onshore processing and export facilities at Djeno\\nTerminal. Production is forecasted to begin in mid-1997 with peak production\\nof 50,000 barrels per day by 1999. In late 1994 the company and its partners\\nsuccessfully drilled an appraisal well in the 1992 Kitina South discovery. The\\ndevelopment of the N\\'Kossa Field started in 1993. Two producing platforms\\nconnected to a floating barge containing processing facilities will allow\\ncrude oil and LPG to be loaded onto tankers for direct export. Production is\\nforecasted to commence in mid-1996 at a rate of 80,000 barrels per day,\\nreaching peak production of about 120,000 barrels per day in 1998.\\n\\nIn Zaire, one development well, one re-drill, and five workovers were\\ncompleted in 1994. Early production from the Tshiala East exploration\\ndiscovery was developed by installation of a satellite production platform and\\ntie-back to existing processing facilities. Additional development planning\\nstudies are underway to evaluate further development of this field.\\n\\nOTHER INTERNATIONAL INCLUDING AFFILIATED COMPANIES: Development expenditures\\nin 1994 were $816 million compared to $737 million in 1993. Additions to\\nproved reserves from extensions, discoveries and improved recoveries were 91\\nmillion barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 708 billion cubic\\nfeet of natural gas.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom the company has interests in over 50 blocks on the U.K.\\nContinental Shelf which total approximately 1.7 million gross acres, including\\nsix producing fields in the North Sea where interests vary from 4.9 to 33.3\\npercent. At the Ninian Field in the North Sea, Chevron (24 percent interest)\\nand its partners are paid a tariff for processing third-party oil and gas\\nproduction using available processing capacity at the Ninian facilities. In\\n1994 third-party oil flowing through the Ninian Field\\'s facilities increased\\nwith production from Columba and Dunbar Fields coming on stream. This follows\\nproduction from Staffa Field which was brought on stream in 1992, Lyell Field\\n(Chevron owns a 33.3 percent interest) in early 1993 and Strathspey Field at\\nyear-end 1993. Production from the first phase of a two-phase development plan\\nfor the North Sea\\'s Alba Field, in which Chevron has a 33 percent interest,\\ncommenced in January 1994. Average daily gross oil production was 42,400\\nbarrels, with a fourth quarter average of 62,900 barrels of oil per day. Plans\\nfor the second phase of Alba, which will develop the southern area of the\\nreservoir, continued in 1994 with conceptual engineering studies to select a\\npreferred development option. A decision is expected by late 1995 which should\\nresult in first production from the southern part of the field in 1996. The\\nBritannia gas field development in the North Sea was approved by the United\\nKingdom Department of Trade and Industry at the end of 1994. Development will\\ninitially consist of a steel drilling, production and accommodation platform\\nand a subsea well center, along with a gas offtake pipeline and onshore gas\\nprocessing facilities. Condensate from the field will be transported ashore\\nvia the Forties pipeline system. Gas and gas liquids will be transported to\\nand processed at the St. Fergus terminal in northeast Scotland. Peak\\nproduction is expected to be approximately 740 million cubic feet of gas and\\n70,000 barrels of condensate per day. Initial production is expected to\\ncommence in late 1998. Agreements have been reached to sell gas to four\\npurchasers. Chevron\\'s share of production is just over 30 percent.\\n\\nIn Canada, the company continues to concentrate its development efforts in six\\ncore producing areas in Alberta and one in Manitoba where operating\\nefficiencies and lower operating costs can be realized using existing\\ninfrastructure. In 1994, the company drilled 49 wells that were targeted at\\nnew reserves around existing fields along with 58 development wells. The\\ncompany also continued its development of the late-1993 Simonette oil\\ndiscovery with further delineation drilling and site construction activities\\nin 1994.\\n\\nChevron has a 27 percent interest in the Hibernia Field, located approximately\\n200 miles offshore Newfoundland. In 1994, the Gravity Based Structure (GBS)\\nwas floated to a deep water construction site where final construction,\\nincluding installation of the topside structures will be completed before mid-\\n1997, the date for its scheduled towing to the drilling site. Engineering cost\\nand construction delays caused by the\\n\\n                                   - 16 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\ncomplexity of the GBS have resulted in higher than projected pre-production\\ncosts for the project. The company is working very closely with the Hibernia\\nManagement Development Company and with partners to keep the project on\\nschedule and to control construction costs. Initial production has been\\ndelayed and is now forecasted for 1998. Hibernia investment is projected to be\\nslightly over $210 million in 1995, an increase of $17 million over 1994\\nlevels. The company\\'s capitalized investment in this project was $570 million\\nat year-end 1994.\\n\\nIn Indonesia, Chevron\\'s interests in 13 contract areas are managed by its 50\\npercent owned P.T. Caltex Pacific Indonesia and Amoseas Indonesia affiliates.\\nThe Duri Steamflood Project, begun in 1985 to assist the difficult production\\nprocess for the relatively heavy, waxy Duri crude, is being completed in 12\\nstages (Areas 1-12). Development of Area 7 is currently underway and steaming\\nbegan early in 1995. Area 8 is due to be on stream early in 1997. More than\\nthree billion additional barrels of oil are expected to be recovered from the\\nDuri Field as a result of steamflooding. Total production at Duri averaged\\n300,000 barrels per day in 1994. A waterflood project involving 21 fields in\\nCentral Sumatra, including the Minas field, continued in 1994. Over the next\\n20 years, waterflood operations will be introduced or expanded at these\\nfields. \\n\\nFirst steam from the Darajat geothermal field, located 115 miles southeast of\\nJakarta, was delivered to Prusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), Indonesia\\'s state\\nelectricity agency, in late 1994. The Darajat I plant was commissioned in late\\n1994 with initial production targeted for PLN\\'s nearby 55-megawatt power\\nplant. Negotiations with the Indonesian government on developing Darajat II is\\nexpected to commence in 1995. This future expansion will allow production to\\nincrease to 130 megawatts by 1999.\\n\\nIn Kazakhstan, the company formed a 50/50 joint venture with Tengizmunaigaz, a\\nsubsidiary of Kazakhstanmunaigaz - the national oil company of the Republic of\\nKazakhstan - to develop the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields on the northeast\\ncoast of the Caspian Sea. This joint venture affiliate, Tengizchevroil (TCO),\\nbegan operations in April 1993. TCO\\'s total production capacity was 65,000\\nbarrels per day for most of 1994. However, production in the early part of\\n1994 was limited to 35,000 barrels per day due to the amount of mercaptans,\\nfoul-smelling sulfur compounds, in the oil. The mercaptan problem was resolved\\nat mid-year through the use of chemical scavengers and exports reached 65,000\\nbarrels per day in the fourth quarter. Production capacity was increased to\\n95,000 barrels per day at year-end with the completion of a second processing\\nplant. By the end of 1995, production capacity is scheduled to increase to\\n130,000 barrels per day and could reach 260,000 barrels per day by the late\\n1990\\'s. However, the pace of further development beyond the 130,000 barrels\\nper day is dependent on the availability of additional export capacity.\\nCurrent production is restricted by the limited transportation facilities\\navailable to TCO to bring the oil to world markets. Tengiz crude oil\\nproduction is currently exchanged for Russian crude which is then exported\\nfrom Russia to world markets. Production levels have been and are continuing\\nto be restricted by the monthly export quotas (currently 65,000 barrels per\\nday) set by Russia under this agreement. The company has been in prolonged\\nnegotiations with the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, composed of the Republics\\nof Russia and Kazakhstan and the Sultanate of Oman, to agree on terms for an\\nexport pipeline system that would enable the project to increase its\\nproduction and sell its output directly to world markets. It is currently\\nimpossible to predict the eventual outcome of these negotiations or its impact\\non the joint venture.\\n\\nIn Australia, drilling commenced in October 1994 in the Goodwyn Field which is\\nbeing developed as part of the North West Shelf Project in which Chevron holds\\na one-sixth interest. Production started in February 1995 with total initial\\nproduction expected at around 10,000 barrels of condensate per day, rising to\\n80,000 barrels of condensate and 900 million cubic feet of natural gas per day\\nat its peak in 1996. First production from the Wanaea and Cossack oil field\\ndevelopment is expected late in 1995. Combined peak production from the two\\noilfields is forecasted at 115,000 barrels of oil per day and should occur in\\nmid-1996. The liquids-rich gas from Wanaea will be combined with gas from the\\nNorth Rankin and Goodwyn fields and processed at the onshore gas plant at\\nKarratha, which is being modified to allow the export sale of LPG. In 1994,\\nChevron and its partners in West Australian Petroleum Pty., Ltd. (WAPET)\\ncontinued to evaluate options for the commercialization of the Gorgon gas\\nfield. The North Gorgon 2 appraisal well was\\n\\n                                   - 17 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nsuccessful with combined tests from four sands of 175 million cubic feet of\\ngas per day. Initial production from the Roller/Skate oilfield development\\ncommenced in May 1994, averaging 40,000 barrels per day. Associated gas from\\nthe Roller/Skate and Saladin fields is being piped to shore and either sold in\\nthe Perth market or stored in the Dongara field for future sales. The Crest\\ndiscovery well was put on extended production tests in 1994 and was producing\\nover 6,000 barrels of oil per day in December. Full field development will\\nconsist of drilling two more wells onshore Thevenard Island and tying them\\ninto existing facilities in mid-1995. Chevron\\'s interest in WAPET projects\\nvaries from 26 to 50 percent.\\n\\nIn Papua New Guinea, Chevron (19 percent interest) and its partners are\\ncurrently undertaking front-end engineering work on the Gobe fields in the\\nsoutheastern portion of the PPL-161 license. This work is expected to lead to\\nthe submission of a Petroleum Development License application to the Papua New\\nGuinea government in 1995. The Gobe fields consist of SE Gobe (discovered in\\n1991) and Gobe Main (discovered in 1993). A delineation program on Gobe Main\\nwas conducted in 1994 that defined the scope of the oil discovery and allowed\\nplanning for a joint development of the two fields to progress. If the\\ngovernment approves the development application in early 1996, initial oil\\nproduction from the Gobe fields will commence in 1997. Chevron and its\\npartners, as well as other competitor groups, have made significant gas\\ndiscoveries in the Papuan Basin. Evaluations for the development of gas\\ndiscoveries in the PPL-101 license (P\\'nyang and Juha gas fields) and the PDL-2\\nlicense (Hedinia field gas cap) are continuing. An active development drilling\\nprogram designed to accelerate production and develop new reserves is\\nscheduled for the Kutubu fields in early 1995. This program, which will\\ncontain both vertical and horizontal wells, is expected to allow production\\nfrom the Kutubu fields to remain at a rate in excess of 100,000 barrels of oil\\nper day throughout 1995.\\n\\nIn China, work continued in 1994 on projects to develop the HZ/32-2 and\\nHZ/32-3 fields in the South China Sea. The plan includes two platforms, 12\\nadditional wells and a tie-in to the existing production facility at the\\nHZ/21-1 Field. Initial production, expected to peak at 45,000 barrels per day,\\nis scheduled for mid-1995. Chevron holds a 16 percent interest in the venture.\\n\\nIn Kuwait, the company signed a three-and-a-half year agreement with the\\nKuwait Oil Company in August 1994 to provide technical services to help\\ndevelop the Burgan Field, the world\\'s second largest oil field.\\n\\n    PETROLEUM - NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS\\n\\nChevron\\'s wholly owned Warren Petroleum Company is engaged in all phases of\\nthe domestic natural gas liquids (NGL\\'s) business and is the largest U.S.\\nwholesale marketer of natural gas liquids, selling to customers in 46 states.\\nWarren also conducts Chevron\\'s international liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)\\ntrading and sales activities.

As a result, in\\n1993, the company announced a major restructuring of the company\\'s downstream\\noperations which included the divestment of refineries in Philadelphia,\\nPennsylvania and Port Arthur, Texas. These refineries no longer fit in\\nChevron\\'s long term plans to have a more strategically focused U.S. refining\\noperation and the divestitures would reduce the capital expenditures that\\nwould have been required to meet the Clean Air Act amendments. The company\\nsold its Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, refinery to Sun Company, Inc. in August\\n1994 and its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery to Clark Refining and Marketing,\\nInc. in February 1995.\\n\\nFederal regulations required that reformulated gasoline (RFG) be sold in nine\\nmandated areas in the United States beginning January 1, 1995. In addition,\\ncertain states and other areas voluntarily opted for the RFG requirement. Some\\nof these areas have subsequently withdrawn, or are considering withdrawing,\\nfrom the voluntary requirement. Also, in some areas complaints have surfaced\\nthat an RFG ingredient, MTBE, is causing illness among users. The company is\\nunable to predict the outcome of these developments on its operations and the\\nindustry. Chevron is selling RFG in a total of nine mandated and voluntary\\nareas.\\n\\nIn 1994, Caltex and its partners continued construction of a grassroots,\\n130,000 barrels per day refinery in Thailand. Mechanical completion of the\\nrefinery is expected by the first quarter of 1996, with full production\\ncommencing by mid-1996. The anticipated fall 1995 completion of the Residuum\\nFluid Catalytic Cracking (RFCC) unit at the Singapore export refinery will\\nmark the completion of that refinery\\'s expansion/upgrade project. The upgrade\\nwill increase refining capacity by 60,000 barrels per day, increase yield of\\nlight products by 33,000 barrels per day, and enable the refinery to produce\\noxygenated unleaded gasoline and low sulfur diesel fuel. At the Yocheon\\nrefinery in South Korea, construction of an RFCC unit is currently underway to\\nposition Caltex\\'s Honam affiliate for Korea\\'s shift to a higher-margin,\\nlighter product mix.\\n\\n    PETROLEUM - REFINED PRODUCTS MARKETING\\n\\nPRODUCT SALES: The company and its Caltex Petroleum Corporation affiliate\\nmarkets petroleum products throughout much of the world.

Worldwide\\nsales volumes, including the company\\'s share of affiliate\\'s sales, averaged\\n2,248 thousand barrels per day in 1994, a decrease of about four percent over\\n1993.

The expansion will increase the plant\\'s\\nproduction capacity of LLDPE by 340 million pounds per year. The plant is also\\ncapable of manufacturing high density polyethylene. These materials are used\\nto produce a variety of products for the packaging industry.\\n\\nThe company is continuing with its previously announced plans to withdraw from\\nits agricultural and consumer product businesses. Plans to shut down the\\ncompany\\'s nitric acid and fertilizer plants in Richmond, California by the end\\nof July 1995 were announced by the company in late January 1995. Chevron sold\\nthe majority of its nitrogen fertilizer business to Unocal in 1991 and has\\noperated the facilities since that time under contract with Unocal. The\\ncompany\\'s remaining fertilizer plant in St. Helens, Oregon is currently for\\nsale.\\n\\n    COAL AND OTHER MINERALS\\n\\nCOAL: The company\\'s wholly-owned coal mining and marketing subsidiary, The\\nPittsburg and Midway Coal Mining Co. (P&M), owned and operated four surface\\nand three underground mines at year-end 1994. Three of the mines are located\\nin New Mexico and one each in Alabama, Wyoming, Kentucky and Colorado. All of\\nthe mines produce steam coal used primarily for electric power generation.\\nP&M\\'s strategy is to focus on regional markets in the United States,\\ncapitalizing on major utility growth markets in the southwest and southeast.\\n\\nIn 1994, the company restructured its interest in the Black Beauty Coal\\nCompany by adding a new partner who contributed both cash and additional coal\\nproperties to the partnership.  This restructuring reduced the company\\'s\\ninterest in the partnership from 50 percent to 33 percent. The Black Beauty\\nCoal Company\\'s principal operations are in the Indiana/Illinois coal market.\\n\\nSales of coal from P&M\\'s wholly-owned mines and from its interest in the Black\\nBeauty Coal Company were 20.4 million tons in 1994, a decrease of\\napproximately 2 percent from 1993 sales of 20.8 million tons. However, 1994\\nproduction was at 94 percent of estimated capacity, a 2 percent increase over\\n1993. About 59 percent of 1994 sales came from two mines, the McKinley Mine in\\nNew Mexico and the Kemmerer Mine in Wyoming. The average selling price for\\ncoal from mines owned and operated by P&M was $24.39 per ton in 1994 compared\\nto $24.62 per ton in 1993, contributing $414 million and $426 million to\\nChevron\\'s consolidated sales and other operating revenues in 1994 and 1993,\\nrespectively. At year-end 1994, P&M controlled approximately 538 million tons\\nof developed and undeveloped coal reserves.\\n\\nDemand growth for coal in the United States remains largely dependent on the\\ndemand for electric power, which in turn depends on regional and national\\neconomic conditions and on competition from other fuel sources. In 1994, the\\nelectric utility industry consumed over 80 percent of all coal produced in the\\nUnited States.\\n\\n                                   - 25 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nApproximately 87 percent of P&M\\'s coal sales are made to electric utilities.\\nOf those sales, about 50 percent are under contracts longer than 10 years and\\n20 percent are under three to ten year contracts. As a result, P&M is not\\nparticularly exposed to short-term fluctuations in market prices. Generally,\\nthese contracts contain negotiated cost pass through and inflation adjustment\\nprovisions.\\n\\nP&M controls a significant inventory of low-sulfur coal reserves, and the\\ncompany expects demand for this type of coal to grow as utilities implement\\ntheir strategies to comply with the air quality emission standards of Phase I\\nof the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which began on January 1, 1995. In\\naddition, P&M anticipates that the Energy Policy Act of 1992 will increase\\ncompetition in the electric power market and will provide new market\\nopportunities for low-cost coal producers.\\n\\nOTHER MINERALS: In 1994, the company completed its previously announced plan\\nto exit the non-coal minerals business by selling its two remaining non-coal\\nassets: the company\\'s 50 percent interest in the Stillwater Mining Company, a\\nMontana platinum-palladium mining operation, and the company\\'s 52.5 percent\\nholding in some zinc-lead prospects in Ireland.\\n\\n    REAL ESTATE\\n\\nThe company\\'s real estate activities are carried out primarily through its\\nwholly owned subsidiaries, Chevron Land and Development Company and Huntington\\nBeach Company (collectively, Chevron Land). Chevron Land\\'s activities are\\npredominantly handled by the company\\'s offices in Newport Beach and San\\nFrancisco, California.\\n\\nReal estate operations have concentrated on converting Chevron\\'s surplus fee\\nproduction properties in California into residential and commercial real\\nestate. After making major infrastructure improvements, the properties are\\nsold to third parties or jointly developed. At the end of 1994, Chevron Land\\nmanaged approximately 35,000 acres of real estate in California. The company\\nalso leases approximately 70,000 acres of irrigated farmland and 160,000 acres\\nof rangeland to local growers and ranchers in California\\'s San Joaquin Valley.\\n\\nChevron Land participates in residential developments through partnerships\\nwith home builders. During 1994, the company sold over 340 homes in\\nCalifornia, more than doubling the 160 homes sold in 1993. The California\\neconomy is now beginning to show signs of renewed economic growth and the\\ncompany is positioning itself to take advantage of the recovery by developing\\nproperties at a pace that meets market demand while preserving current real\\nestate development entitlements.\\n\\nIn addition to its sales of residential real estate, the company also\\ngenerated over $140 million in revenues from about 25 sales involving\\ncommercial, recreational or undeveloped real estate. The largest of these\\nsales involved the sale of two undeveloped properties to Kaufman and Broad and\\nthe sale of two golf courses and related facilities to Club Corporation of\\nAmerica. These sales were made through the company\\'s 80 percent interest in\\nthe Coto de Caza Partnership.\\n\\nThe company announced in March 1995 that it has established a marketing team\\nfor the possible sale of its real estate development assets. If a satisfactory\\nprice and other terms can be obtained, the company hopes to conclude the sale\\nin 1995.\\n\\n    RESEARCH AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\\n\\nRESEARCH: The company\\'s principal research laboratories are at Richmond and La\\nHabra, California. The Richmond facility engages in research on new and\\nimproved refinery processes, develops petroleum and chemical products, and\\nprovides technical services for the company and its customers. The La Habra\\nfacility conducts research and provides technical support in geology,\\ngeophysics and other exploration science, as well as oil production methods\\nsuch as hydraulics, assisted recovery programs and drilling, including\\noffshore drilling. Employees in subsidiaries engaged primarily in research\\nactivities at year-end 1994 numbered approximately 2,000.\\n\\n                                   - 26 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nChevron\\'s research and development expenses were $179 million, $206 million\\nand $229 million for the years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.\\n\\nIn 1994, the company developed a synthetic-based drilling mud for offshore\\nuse. Drilling mud is a liquid mixture that transports drill cuttings or small\\nrock fragments out of the well. Conventional oil-based muds produce toxic oil-\\ncoated cuttings that are illegal to dispose of offshore. The new synthetic\\ndrilling mud meets all environmental requirements for discharge directly into\\nthe ocean, thereby eliminating the additional expense needed to transport and\\ndispose of the cutting onshore.\\n\\nThe company signed an agreement in 1994 with Excel Paralubes, a joint venture\\nof Conoco Inc. and Pennzoil Products Co., which licensed the company\\'s\\nIsodewaxing technology for a new lube oil manufacturing facility to be built\\nat Conoco\\'s Lake Charles refinery in Westlake, Louisiana. The Isodewaxing\\ntechnology was also selected by Petro-Canada for a major expansion of their\\nlube oil facilities in Mississauga, Ontario. Isodewaxing is a catalytic\\nprocess that changes the characteristics of waxy molecules in crude\\nfeedstocks, resulting in a greater yield of high-quality base oils at a lower\\noperating cost than conventional solvent based processing. The Petro-Canada\\nfacility is expected to come on stream in the fourth quarter 1996, followed by\\nthe Excel Paralube facility in 1997. The company also licensed, in 1994, its\\nresiduum desulfurization technology to Tohoku Oil Co. of Japan for its 100,000\\nbarrel per day Sendai refinery and to Formosa Petrochemical Corporation for\\nits 450,000 barrel per day refinery in Taiwan.\\n\\nLicenses under the company\\'s patents are generally made available to others in\\nthe petroleum and chemical industries. However, the company\\'s business is not\\ndependent upon licensing patents. \\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: One of Chevron\\'s corporate strategies is to give\\nhigh priority to environmental, public and governmental concerns. Chevron\\'s\\nrevised corporate policy on Health, Environment and Safety was approved by the\\nstockholders in 1991. In 1992, a comprehensive series of 102 management\\npractices was approved by senior management to strengthen the implementation\\nof the policy. The program is called \"Protecting People and the Environment\"\\nand is modeled after the Chemical Manufacturers Associations\\' program called\\n\"Responsible Care.\" It is also similar to the American Petroleum Institute\\'s\\nprogram called \"Strategies for Today\\'s Environmental Partnership.\" In 1994,\\nthe company published an environmental, health and safety performance report\\nnamed \"Measuring Progress - A Report on Chevron\\'s Environmental Performance.\"\\nThis report describes the company\\'s environmental performance since its last\\nenvironmental report issued in 1990 and summarizes the company\\'s policy and\\napproach to environmental protection.\\n\\nThe company\\'s oil and gas exploration activities, along with those of many\\nother petroleum companies, have been hampered by drilling moratoria, imposed\\nbecause of environmental concerns, in areas where the company has leasehold\\ninterests, particularly Alaska, offshore Florida and offshore California.\\nDifficulties and delays in obtaining necessary permits, such as those\\nexperienced by Chevron and its partners in the Point Arguello Field offshore\\nCalifornia, can delay or restrict oil and gas development projects. While\\nevents such as these can impact current and future earnings, either directly\\nor through lost opportunities, the company does not believe they will have a\\nmaterial effect on the company\\'s consolidated financial position, its\\nliquidity, or its competitive position relative to other domestic or\\ninternational petroleum concerns. The situation has, however, been a factor,\\namong others, in the shift of the company\\'s exploration efforts to areas\\noutside of the United States.\\n\\nSince 1991, the company has spent about $1.2 billion in capital expenditures\\non air quality projects at its refining facilities, primarily in order to\\ncomply with federal and state clean air regulations and to provide consumers\\nwith fuels that reduce air pollution and air toxicity. The Clean Air Act\\nAmendments of 1990 require that only reformulated gasoline (RFG) may be sold\\nin the nine worst ozone areas in the United States beginning on January 1,\\n1995 while other areas may voluntarily opt into the RFG requirement. Chevron\\nbegan selling RFG in nine areas in 1995. The California Air Resources Board\\nrequires a more stringent reformulated gasoline be sold statewide beginning in\\nMarch 1996 and work is continuing at the company\\'s Richmond and El Segundo,\\nCalifornia, refineries to meet these requirements.\\n\\n                                   - 27 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nThe Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) expanded federal authority to\\ndirect responses to oil spills to improve preparedness and response\\ncapabilities and to impose penalties on spillers for restoration costs and\\nloss of use of the resources during restoration. Under OPA, the U.S. Coast\\nGuard imposed new regulations on owners of vessels operating in U.S. waters\\nafter December 28, 1994 which required owners to meet strict guidelines for\\nfinancial responsibility in the case of an oil spill. The company complied\\nwith the requirements by self-insurance and was issued a Certificate of\\nFinancial Responsibility for each of its vessels operating in U.S. waters\\nprior to the December 28 deadline. OPA also requires the scheduled phase-out\\nof single hull tankers for trading to U.S. ports, which has resulted in the\\nutilization of more costly double hull tankers. Many of the coastal states\\nhave enacted or are preparing legislation in these same areas. In 1994, the\\ncompany took delivery of two double hull tankers, the last of seven such\\nvessels ordered in 1990. The company has been actively involved in the Marine\\nPreservation Association, a non-profit organization that funds the Marine\\nSpill Response Corporation (MSRC). MSRC owns the largest stockpile of oil\\nspill response equipment in the nation and operates five strategically located\\nU.S. coastal regional centers.\\n\\nThe company expects the enactment of additional federal and state regulations\\naddressing the issue of waste management and disposal and effluent emission\\nlimitations for offshore oil and gas operations. While the costs of operating\\nin an environmentally responsible manner and complying with existing and\\nanticipated environmental legislation and regulations, including loss\\ncontingencies for prior operations, are expected to be significant, the\\ncompany anticipates that these costs will not have a material impact on its\\nconsolidated financial position, its liquidity, or its competitive position in\\nthe industry.\\n\\nIn 1994, the company\\'s U.S. capitalized environmental expenditures were $645\\nmillion, representing approximately 33 percent of the company\\'s total\\nconsolidated U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures. The company\\'s U.S.\\ncapitalized environmental expenditures were $620 million and $430 million in\\n1993 and 1992, respectively. These environmental expenditures include capital\\noutlays to retrofit existing facilities, as well as those associated with new\\nfacilities. The expenditures are predominantly in the petroleum segment and\\nrelate mostly to air and water quality projects and activities at the\\ncompany\\'s refineries, oil and gas producing facilities and marketing\\nfacilities. For 1995, the company estimates that capital expenditures for\\nenvironmental control facilities will be approximately $558 million. The\\nactual expenditures for 1995 will depend on various conditions affecting the\\ncompany\\'s operations and may differ significantly from the company\\'s forecast.\\nThe company is committed to protecting the environment wherever it operates,\\nincluding strict compliance with all governmental regulations. The future\\nannual capital costs of fulfilling this commitment are uncertain, but are\\nexpected to decrease after expenditures required to produce fuels that reduce\\nair pollution and air toxicity reached their peak in 1994.\\n\\nUnder provisions of the Superfund law, Chevron has been designated as a\\npotentially responsible party (PRP) for remediation of a portion of 238\\nhazardous waste sites. Since remediation costs will vary from site to site as\\nwell as the company\\'s share of responsibility for each site, the number of\\nsites in which the company has been identified as a PRP should not be used as\\na relevant measure of total liability. At year-end 1994, the company\\'s\\nenvironmental remediation reserve related to Superfund sites amounted to $61\\nmillion. Forecasted expenditures for the largest of these sites, located in\\nCalifornia, amounts to approximately 20 percent of the reserve.\\n\\nThe company\\'s 1994 environmental expenditures, remediation provisions and\\nyear-end environmental reserves are discussed on pages FS-2 through FS-4 of\\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. These pages also contain additional\\ndiscussion of the company\\'s liabilities and exposure under the Superfund law\\nand additional discussion of the effects of the Clean Air Act Amendments of\\n1990.\\n\\n                                   - 28 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nITEM 2.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\n\\nA.   CITIES SERVICE TENDER OFFER CASES.\\nThe complaint by Cities Service Co. (\"Cities Service\") and two individual\\nplaintiffs was originally filed in August 1982 in Oklahoma state court in\\nTulsa. Prior proceedings have effectively eliminated the two individual\\nplaintiffs as parties. The defendants were initially Gulf Oil Corporation and\\nGOC Acquisition Corporation. Subsequent filings have identified Chevron U.S.A.\\nInc. as the successor in interest to Gulf Oil Corporation. In the original\\ncomplaint Cities Service pleaded for damages of not less than $2.7 billion\\ntogether with legal interest for breach of contract and misrepresentation. The\\ngreat bulk of the damages were related to claims on behalf of shareholders of\\nCities Service. All of the claims by Cities Service shareholders have been\\ndismissed.\\n\\nPlaintiff Cities Service filed its Second Amended Petition on April 25, 1994,\\nadding Oxy U.S.A. as the successor to plaintiff Cities Service, adding Chevron\\nU.S.A. Inc. as successor to Gulf Oil Corporation and adding Chevron\\nCorporation as a new defendant. In addition to the existing claims for breach\\nof contract and fraud, the amendments added the following causes of action:\\nwillful and malicious breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation,\\ninterference with prospective economic advantage in connection with the 1989\\nproposed Oxy-Cities Department of Energy (\"DOE\") settlement, and the claimed\\nDOE liability as additional contract damages and as additional fraud damages.\\nThe amendment also added a claim for punitive damages based upon the alleged\\nfraud, negligent misrepresentation, willful breach and interference claims and\\nrequested not less than $100 million on each of the several claims, together\\nwith pre-judgment interest and punitive damages. It also requested $12 million\\nplus prejudgment interest for Cities\\' costs in defending against DOE\\nproceedings since 1989, and an order entitling Cities Service to recover such\\n\"restitutionary obligation\" amounts ultimately paid by Oxy U.S.A. to the DOE\\nin excess of its proposed 1989 DOE settlement, and punitive damages.\\n\\nDefendants answered, in part, the plaintiff\\'s Second Amended Petition and\\nmoved to dismiss the claims for negligent misrepresentation, malicious breach\\nof contract and interference with prospective economic advantage. In addition,\\ndefendant Chevron Corporation moved to dismiss the petition for lack of\\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe motion to dismiss the new tort claim and certain other claims was denied\\nand an answer to these claims was timely filed. Chevron Corporation\\'s motion\\nto dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was granted on September 7, 1994.\\nPlaintiff\\'s motion to dismiss defendants\\' counterclaim was also granted.\\n\\nThe Oklahoma Supreme Court has denied defendants\\' petition for certiorari on\\nthe trial court\\'s certified interlocutory order concerning the defenses based\\nupon certain conditions in the contract and alleged misstatements by plaintiff\\nconcerning its potential DOE liability.\\n\\nPlaintiff\\'s motion to bifurcate this case for two trials was granted by the\\ntrial court on January 23, 1995. The first trial will concern plaintiff\\'s\\nclaims for alleged breach of contract, willful and malicious breach of\\ncontract, and negligent misrepresentation. The second trial will cover\\nplaintiff\\'s claims for alleged interference with prospective economic\\nadvantage in connection with the proposed 1989 DOE settlement, and the claimed\\nDOE liability as additional damages under another claim of breach of contract.\\n\\nVarious discovery motions are pending. There is no discovery cut-off and no\\ntrial date has yet been set.\\n\\n                                   - 29 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nB.   IN RE GULF PENSION LITIGATION.\\nIn two lawsuits, which were commenced on December 2, 1986 and April 24, 1987\\nand consolidated on July 17, 1987 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\\nDistrict of Texas as IN RE GULF PENSION LITIGATION, former employees of Gulf\\nOil Corporation who were participants in the Gulf Pension Plan contended that\\na partial termination of the Gulf Pension Plan had occurred and they were\\nentitled to immediate vesting and distribution of plan benefits and to\\ndistribution of alleged excess plan assets, which allegedly had been\\nunlawfully seized by Gulf or Chevron. All aspects of this case have now been\\nresolved except for plaintiffs\\' claim to entitlement to $620 million in\\nsurplus funds in the Gulf Pension Plan. This issue was decided adversely to\\nplaintiffs by the District Court on April 10, 1991.\\n\\nOn October 21, 1994, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District\\nCourt\\'s determination that the plaintiffs were not entitled to surplus assets\\nof the Gulf Pension Plan. On November 18, 1994, plaintiffs filed a petition\\nfor rehearing and a suggestion for rehearing en banc with the Fifth Circuit.\\nBoth of these were denied on December 1, 1994.\\n\\nOn March 1, 1995, the plaintiffs filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\\nwith the United States Supreme Court.\\n\\nC.   PERTH AMBOY NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARD PENALTY.\\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claims that Chevron\\'s\\nPerth Amboy refinery violated various provisions of the Clean Air Act New\\nSource Performance Standards (\"NSPS\") as a result of refinery modifications\\nconducted in 1973 and 1983. The EPA issued a compliance order in November 1993\\nand in 1994 issued a formal determination that the NSPS applied to the\\nrefinery. This NSPS applicability determination has been appealed to the\\nUnited States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The EPA\\'s\\npenalty demand is $15.2 million. Chevron has made a counteroffer of $150,000.\\n\\nD.   PREMANUFACTURE NOTIFICATION FOR DETERGENT ADDITIVES.\\nOn September 30,1993, the EPA instituted an administrative proceeding,\\nassessing civil penalties of about $17 million for alleged violations of the\\nToxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The EPA contends that the company was\\nrequired to file Premanufacture Notifications (PMNs) with regard to six\\nchemical substances manufactured or imported since 1990. The company believes\\nthat no PMNs were required because the chemicals were within the scope of\\nexisting TSCA inventory listings. Nevertheless, the company reported the\\nsituation to the EPA when it was advised by a third party that the EPA may,\\nwithout public notice, have revised its interpretation of TSCA regulations to\\nrequire PMNs to be filed in such circumstances. Thereafter, under protest, the\\ncompany suspended the production and importation of the chemicals and filed\\nPMNs for them, continuing the suspension for the 90-day period contemplated by\\nTSCA. The detergents in question are very similar to common detergents and\\nintermediates used in their production, and the EPA does not appear to claim\\nthat failure to file a PMN resulted in any health or safety risk. The EPA\\npermitted the company to dispose of its current stocks of the chemicals during\\nthe period that the company suspended their production and importation. The\\ncompany has challenged the penalty assessment through an administrative\\nappeal.\\n\\nE.   EL SEGUNDO REFINERY REFORMULATED GASOLINE PROJECT.\\nOn September 22, 1993, the EPA instituted an administrative proceeding\\ncontending that the company had not received a permit required under the Clean\\nAir Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) for field activities at the El Segundo\\nrefinery relating to the production of reformulated gasolines, which was\\nfederally mandated by January 1, 1995 under other provisions of the CAAA. All\\ncompany activities had been conducted in accordance with authorization by the\\nSouth Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), the primary enforcing\\nagency of the rule that the EPA contends the company violated. EPA efforts to\\ncause the company to cease all construction activities were stayed by the\\nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals, and SCAQMD has since issued the company a\\nformal permit to construct. The EPA also sought civil penalties from the\\ncompany for activities conducted prior to the issuance of the permit. The\\ncompany has declined to accept the EPA\\'s penalty demand of $1.635 million and\\nis in the process of formulating a counteroffer. The matter has been referred\\nto the Department of Justice for enforcement.\\n\\n                                   - 30 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nF.   PORT ARTHUR REFINERY ASSESSMENT.\\nOn August 3, 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Notice\\nof Violation and Civil Penalty Assessment against the Port Arthur Refinery,\\nalleging exceedances of the refinery\\'s water discharge permit on 24 occasions\\nbetween 1989 and 1994. The EPA further alleged various violations of record-\\nkeeping and reporting requirements regarding monitoring of the wastewater\\neffluent discharge pursuant to the permit. The EPA sought civil penalties in\\nexcess of $100,000. The refinery denied all allegations, many of which were\\nsubject to the \"upset\" defense available to dischargers during extraordinary\\nweather events and temporary maintenance of wastewater treatment equipment.\\nWithout admitting liability, Chevron agreed to pay a fine of $124,000 and to\\nimplement various changes in recordkeeping procedures.\\n\\nG.   CHEVRON PIPELINE COMPANY PENALTY ASSESSMENT.\\nBy letter dated December 13, 1994, the EPA alleged that Chevron has violated\\nthe New Source Performance Standards applicable to petroleum liquid storage\\nvessels (\"Subpart Ka\") and thereby has violated section 111(e) of the Clean\\nAir Act. More particularly, the EPA contends that one petroleum liquid storage\\nvessel at Chevron\\'s pipeline facility in La Mirada, California, has\\ncontinuously operated in violation of one provision of Subpart Ka since 1979.\\nThe EPA has proposed a civil penalty of $306,000 for Chevron\\'s alleged\\nviolation of the Act.

However, special items in all years, and the\\ncumulative effect of adopting two new accounting standards in 1992, affected\\nthe comparability of the company\\'s reported results. Special items, after\\nrelated tax effects, increased earnings in 1994 by $22 million, decreased\\nearnings in 1993 by $883 million and increased earnings in 1992 by $651\\nmillion. Also, the cumulative effect of adopting two new accounting standards\\nreduced 1992 earnings $641 million. Excluding the effects of special items in\\nall years and the 1992 accounting changes, 1994 earnings of $1.671 billion\\ndeclined 22 percent from very strong operating earnings of $2.148 billion in\\n1993 and increased 7 percent from $1.559 billion in 1992.\\n\\nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK. Worldwide petroleum industry conditions\\nwere weak throughout 1994. Crude oil prices were at a five-year low at the\\nbeginning of the year. Although prices recovered somewhat during the year,\\nsupplies remained plentiful. The company\\'s U.S. realizations were, on average,\\n72 cents per barrel less than in the prior year, and its international\\nrealizations declined $1.23 per barrel. Average crude oil prices have declined\\nfor four consecutive years.\\n\\nU.S. natural gas prices, after increasing the past two years, began falling in\\n1994 and averaged 22 cents per thousand cubic feet less than in 1993, as ample\\nsupplies and mild weather held down prices. The company\\'s international\\nnatural gas prices fell by about the same amount.\\n\\nSales margins on refined products were depressed much of the year. For\\nexample, in the United States, product prices averaged about $1 per barrel\\nless than in the previous year as highly competitive markets, particularly in\\nthe East, held down prices. These market conditions tended to lengthen the\\ntime lag for product prices to reflect the gradually increasing crude oil\\ncosts during the year.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the chemicals industry experienced a dramatic turnaround\\nfrom the excess capacity and weak demand of the past four years. Strengthening\\nindustrialized economies, particularly in the United States, resulted in\\nstrong demand and higher prices - and Chevron\\'s chemicals earnings rebounded\\nsubstantially.\\n\\nAll these industry conditions have continued into 1995. The company\\'s posted\\nprice for West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a benchmark crude oil, was $16.75 per\\nbarrel at year-end 1994 and $17.50 at February 28, 1995. The Henry Hub natural\\ngas spot price, an industry marker, was $1.61 per thousand cubic feet at\\nyear-end 1994 and $1.55 at February 28, 1995. U.S. refined products prices in\\nJanuary 1995 were about flat with December. Planned major maintenance\\nshutdowns at two of the company\\'s core refineries resulted in lower refinery\\nutilization rates, lower sales volumes and increased product purchases in the\\nearly part of 1995. Chemicals operations remained strong.\\n\\nChevron began selling federally mandated reformulated gasoline January 1, 1995\\nin nine areas in the United States, accounting for about 20 percent of its\\nJanuary gasoline sales volumes. The increased cost of manufacturing\\nreformulated gasoline has not yet been fully reflected in sales prices.\\n\\nThe company embarked on an aggressive program several years ago to increase\\nits competitiveness and achieve superior returns for its stockholders.\\nBusinesses were restructured, marginal and non-core assets were divested and\\nthe company\\'s cost structure was significantly reduced. At\\n\\n                                  FS-1\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nthe same time, the company has selectively pursued growth opportunities in its\\nareas of strength.\\n\\nThe company continues to review and analyze its operations and may incur\\nfuture charges related to the restructuring of its businesses and disposition\\nof marginal or non-strategic assets. In particular, the company is currently\\nreviewing its oil and gas operations in western Canada and options to maximize\\nthe value of certain real estate operations located in California.\\n\\n\\nUNITED STATES REFINING AND MARKETING DEVELOPMENTS. In connection with the\\npreviously announced restructuring of its U.S. downstream operations, Chevron\\nsold its Philadelphia refinery in August 1994 and its Port Arthur, Texas,\\nrefinery in February 1995. The two refineries had a combined capacity of about\\n350,000 barrels per day or about 25 percent of the company\\'s total U.S.\\nrefining capacity prior to the sales. The Philadelphia refinery had been\\noperated as a merchant refinery, with its 175,000 barrels per day output sold\\nto independent petroleum marketers. Products for the company\\'s marketing\\nsystem that were previously supplied by the Port Arthur refinery will be\\nobtained from other sources.\\n\\nThe restructuring reflected the company\\'s strategy to focus its resources in\\nthe West, Southwest and those parts of the South where the company\\'s marketing\\nbusiness is strongest. The smaller refinery organization is expected to be\\nmore efficient, with improved cash flow and return on capital employed. The\\ndisposition of the two refineries has also eliminated large capital\\ninvestments that would have otherwise been required.\\n\\nIn connection with the Port Arthur refinery sale, the company retained certain\\nenvironmental cleanup obligations. The company has accrued for presently\\nanticipated costs of $282 million, most of which will be expended over\\napproximately the next ten years. It is possible additional provisions may be\\nnecessary in the future. The expenditures will be funded by future cash flows\\nfrom operations, with no material effect anticipated on the company\\'s\\nliquidity.\\n\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION DEVELOPMENTS. Liquids production from\\n50 percent owned Tengizchevroil (TCO), a joint venture with the Republic of\\nKazakhstan, averaged about 46,000 barrels per day in 1994, up from 30,000\\nbarrels per day in 1993. At year-end 1994 TCO was producing about 65,000\\nbarrels per day. With the completion of a second processing plant in December\\n1994, production capacity increased to 95,000 barrels per day and is scheduled\\nto increase to 130,000 barrels per day by the end of 1995. Beyond this, the\\npace of further field development is dependent on the availability of\\nadditional export capability. Production levels are dependent on monthly\\nexport quotas set by Russia, under a transportation/exchange agreement, and\\nare currently set at 65,000 barrels per day. Chevron has been in prolonged\\nnegotiations with the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, composed of the Republics\\nof Russia and Kazakhstan and the Sultanate of Oman, to agree on terms for an\\nexport pipeline system that would enable the project to sell its output\\ndirectly to world markets.\\n\\nAlthough the company\\'s operations in Nigeria and the Angolan exclave of\\nCabinda have been generally unaffected by the political uncertainty and civil\\nunrest that continues to exist in those countries, the company continues to\\nclosely monitor developments. Chevron has significant oil producing properties\\nin both countries and has major development projects underway. In 1994, the\\ncompany\\'s net share of production in Nigeria averaged about 130,000 barrels\\nper day, and in Angola about 100,000 barrels per day.\\n\\nChevron\\'s partner in Nigeria, the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum\\nCorporation (NNPC) has fallen behind in paying its cash calls to Chevron, as\\nwell as to other oil companies operating in Nigeria. However, NNPC continues\\nto make payments and the company believes all amounts owed it will ultimately\\nbe paid.\\n\\nThe Nigerian government effectively devalued its currency, the naira, in\\nJanuary 1995 by changing from a fixed exchange rate to a floating, free market\\nrate. This devaluation did not have a significant effect on the financial\\nposition of the company\\'s Nigerian subsidiary and is not expected to have a\\nsignificant effect on its ongoing operations.\\n\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the\\ncompany engages are subject to various federal, state and local environmental,\\nhealth and safety laws and regulations. These regulatory requirements continue\\nto increase in both number and complexity, and govern not only the manner in\\nwhich the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells.\\nMost of the costs of complying with myriad laws and regulations pertaining to\\nits operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of conducting its\\nbusiness.\\n\\n                                  FS-2\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nUsing definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum\\nInstitute, Chevron estimates its worldwide environmental spending in 1994 was\\nabout $1.5 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these\\nexpenditures were $683 million of environmental capital expenditures, and $638\\nmillion of costs associated with the control and abatement of hazardous\\nsubstances and pollutants from ongoing operations. The total amount also\\nincludes spending charged against reserves established for future\\nenvironmental cleanup programs (but not non-cash provisions recorded during\\nthe year).\\n\\nIn addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its\\nongoing operations and products, the company (as well as other companies\\nengaged in the petroleum or chemicals industries) incurs expenses for\\ncorrective actions at various facilities and waste disposal sites. An\\nobligation to take remedial action may be incurred as a result of the\\nenactment of laws, such as the federal Superfund law, or the issuance of new\\nregulations or as the result of the company\\'s own policies in this area.\\nAccidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course\\nof business. In addition, an obligation may arise when operations are closed\\nor sold. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to\\nfacilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures\\nthat were considered acceptable under standards existing at the time, but now\\nrequire investigatory and/or remedial work to meet current standards.\\n\\nDuring 1994, the company recorded $505 million of before-tax provisions to\\nprovide for environmental remediation efforts, including Superfund sites.\\nActual expenditures charged against these provisions and other previously\\nestablished reserves amounted to $182 million in 1994. At year-end 1994, the\\ncompany\\'s environmental remediation reserve was $1.219 billion, including $61\\nmillion related to Superfund sites.\\n\\nUnder provisions of the Superfund law, the Environmental Protection Agency\\n(EPA) has designated Chevron a potentially responsible party (PRP), or has\\notherwise involved it, in the remediation of 238 hazardous waste sites. At\\nyear-end 1994, the company\\'s cumulative share of costs and settlements for\\napproximately 168 of these sites, for which payments or provisions have been\\nmade in 1994 and prior years, was about $96 million, including a provision of\\n$16 million made during 1994. No single site is expected to result in a\\nmaterial liability for the company at this time. For the remaining sites,\\ninvestigations are not yet at a stage where the company is able to quantify a\\nprobable liability or determine a range of reasonably possible exposure. The\\nSuperfund law provides for joint and several liability. Any future actions by\\nthe EPA and other regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other\\nresponsible parties\\' costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not\\nexpected to have a material effect on the company\\'s consolidated financial\\nposition or liquidity.\\n\\nGenerally, provisions are recorded for work at identified sites where an\\nassessment or cleanup plan has been developed and for which costs can\\nreasonably be estimated. In 1994, the company recorded environmental\\nremediation provisions aggregating $223 million for its U.S. marketing sites\\nwhere no specific contamination had yet been identified, using estimates based\\non its history of required remediation at other similar sites.\\n\\nIt is likely the company will continue to incur additional charges for\\nenvironmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are\\nindeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible\\ncontamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that\\nmay be required, the determination of the company\\'s liability in proportion to\\nother responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable\\nfrom third parties. While the amounts of future costs may be material to the\\ncompany\\'s results of operations in the period in which they are recognized,\\nthe company does not expect these costs to have a material effect on its\\nconsolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does not\\nbelieve its obligations to make such expenditures have had or will have any\\nsignificant impact on the company\\'s competitive position relative to other\\ndomestic or international petroleum or chemicals concerns. Although\\nenvironmental compliance costs are substantial, the company has no reason to\\nbelieve they vary significantly from similar costs incurred by other companies\\nengaged in similar businesses in similar areas. The company believes that such\\ncosts ultimately are reflected in the petroleum and chemicals industries\\'\\nprices for products and services.\\n\\nThe petroleum industry is incurring major capital expenditures to meet\\nclean-air regulations, such as the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act in the\\nUnited States. For companies operating in California, where Chevron has a\\nsignificant presence, the California Air Resources Board has imposed even\\nstricter requirements. The company\\'s worldwide capital expenditures related to\\nair quality are believed to have peaked at $495 million in 1994. For 1995,\\ntotal worldwide environ-\\n\\n                                  FS-3\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nmental capital expenditures are estimated at $622 million, of which $438\\nmillion are expected to be spent on air quality related measures. This is in\\naddition to the ongoing costs of complying with other environmental regulations\\nand the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.\\n\\nIn addition to the reserves for environmental remediation discussed above, the\\ncompany maintains reserves for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of\\nits worldwide oil and gas and coal properties at the end of their productive\\nlives. Most such costs are environmentally related. Provisions are recognized\\non a unit-of-production basis as the properties are produced. The amount of\\nthese reserves at year-end 1994 was $1.520 billion and is included in\\naccumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization in the company\\'s\\nconsolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nFor the company\\'s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries, no\\nprovisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such\\nassets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or\\notherwise abandon the facility has been made.\\n\\n\\nOTHER CONTINGENCIES. At year-end 1994 the company had $257 million of suspended\\nexploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment. The wells are\\nsuspended pending the drilling of additional wells to determine if commercially\\nproducible quantities of oil and gas are present. These well costs will be\\ncapitalized or expensed depending on the results of this future drilling\\nactivity.\\n\\nThe company is the subject of various lawsuits and claims and other contingent\\nliabilities. These are discussed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated\\nfinancial statements. The company believes that the resolution of these matters\\nwill not materially affect its financial position or liquidity.\\n\\nThe company utilizes various derivative instruments to manage its exposure to\\nprice risk stemming from its integrated petroleum activities. Some of the\\ninstruments may be settled by delivery of the underlying commodity, whereas\\nothers can only be settled by cash. All these instruments are commonly used in\\nthe global trade of petroleum products and are relatively straightforward,\\ninvolve little complexity and are substantially of a short-term duration. Most\\nof the activity in these instruments is intended to hedge a physical\\ntransaction, hence gains and losses arising from these instruments offset, and\\nare recognized concurrently with, gains and losses from the underlying\\ncommodities.\\n\\n\\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. In the 1994 first quarter, the company adopted two\\nnew accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)\\nNo. 112, \"Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits\" and SFAS 115,\\n\"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.\" The\\nadoption of these standards did not have a material effect on the company\\'s\\nconsolidated financial statements and had no effect on its liquidity. The 1994\\nconsolidated financial statements also include the disclosures required by SFAS\\n119, \"Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of\\nFinancial Instruments,\" dealing with instruments that can only be settled in\\ncash.\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL ITEMS. Net income is affected by transactions that are unrelated to, or\\nare not representative of, the company\\'s ongoing operations for the periods\\npresented. These transactions, defined by management and designated \"special\\nitems,\" can obscure the underlying results of operations for a year as well as\\naffect comparability between years.

In\\n1994, prior-year tax adjustments increased earnings $344 million, including the\\n\\n                                  FS-4\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nnet reversal of $301 million of tax and related interest reserves resulting\\nfrom the company\\'s global settlement with the Internal Revenue Service for\\nissues relating to the years 1979 through 1987. Tax adjustments decreased\\nearnings $130 million in 1993, which included the effect of a one percent\\nincrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, but increased earnings by $72\\nmillion in 1992.\\n\\nASSET DISPOSITIONS in 1994 consisted of the sale of the company\\'s lead and zinc\\nprospect in Ireland, generating an after-tax profit of $48 million. This sale\\ncompleted the company\\'s withdrawal from non-coal minerals activities. The Ortho\\nlawn and garden products business was the major asset sold in 1993, generating\\na $130 million gain. In addition, oil and gas properties in the United States\\nand Indonesia, undeveloped coal properties in the United States and marketing\\nassets in Central America were sold in 1993 resulting in a net loss of $8\\nmillion. In 1992, assets sold included oil and gas properties in the United\\nStates, United Kingdom, Canada and Sudan; a fertilizer business in the United\\nStates; and a copper interest in Chile. In addition, the stock of a U.S. oil\\nand gas subsidiary was exchanged for 31,500,000 shares of Chevron stock, a\\ntransaction valued at $1.1 billion. The combination of these and other smaller\\nsales resulted in after-tax gains of $757 million in 1992.\\n\\nASSET WRITE-OFFS AND REVALUATIONS in 1993 were comprised of certain U.S.\\nrefinery assets, U.S. and Canadian production assets, and miscellaneous\\ncorporate assets. Asset write-offs in 1992 consisted of a $110 million\\nwrite-down of the company\\'s Beaufort Sea oil properties and a net $23 million\\ncharge related to certain U.S. refining, marketing and chemical fertilizer\\nassets.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PROVISIONS pertain to estimated future costs for\\nenvironmental cleanup programs at certain of the company\\'s U.S. service\\nstations, marketing terminals, refineries, chemical locations and oil and gas\\nproperties; divested operations in which Chevron has liability for future\\ncleanup costs; and sites, commonly referred to as Superfund sites, for which\\nthe company has been designated a PRP by the EPA. In addition to environmental\\nremediation and cleanup costs included in the 1994 and 1993 restructuring\\ncharges discussed below, provisions for environmental remediation amounted to\\n$304 million in 1994, $90 million in 1993, and $44 million in 1992.\\n\\nRESTRUCTURINGS AND REORGANIZATIONS charges in 1994 were a net $45 million\\naddition to the $543 million charge provided in 1993 to restructure the\\ncompany\\'s U.S. refining and marketing business. The 1994 adjustment included $6\\nmillion applicable to the effect of the restructuring on the company\\'s\\nchemicals operations. The adjustment also included the result of environmental\\nremediation actions agreed to with regulatory agencies, and retained by the\\ncompany, in connection with the terms of the sale of the Port Arthur refinery.\\n\\nThe 1993 charge was composed primarily of a write-down of the company\\'s\\nPhiladelphia and Port Arthur refinery facilities and related inventories to\\ntheir realizable values. In estimating the refineries\\' realizable values, the\\ncompany took into account certain environmental cleanup obligations. The\\ncharges also included provisions for environmental site assessments and\\nemployee severance.\\n\\nThe Philadelphia refinery was sold in August 1994 and the Port Arthur refinery\\nwas sold in February 1995. At year-end 1994, the reserve balance of $715\\nmillion, before tax, was comprised of $491 million applicable to the loss on\\nthe Port Arthur facilities and inventories and $224 million for retained future\\nPort Arthur environmental cleanup obligations. Additional Port Arthur\\nenvironmental reserves had been established prior to the decision to sell the\\nrefinery.\\n\\nIn 1992, Chevron recorded a net charge of $40 million associated with\\nrestructuring and work-force reductions in connection with the company\\'s\\nenhanced early retirement program.\\n\\nLIFO INVENTORY LIQUIDATION LOSSES result from the reduction of inventories in\\ncertain inventory pools valued under the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) accounting\\nmethod. LIFO losses decreased net income in 1994, 1993 and 1992 by $10 million,\\n$46 million and $26 million, respectively, as inventories were liquidated at\\nhigher than then-current costs. These amounts include the company\\'s equity\\nshare of Caltex LIFO inventory effects. Chevron\\'s consolidated petroleum\\ninventories were 99 million barrels at year-end 1994 and 1993 and 105 million\\nbarrels at year-end 1992.\\n\\nOTHER SPECIAL ITEMS in 1994 included charges for litigation and regulatory\\nsettlements of $31 million, which were partially offset by a casualty insurance\\nrecovery of $20 million. In 1993, net additions of $70 million to reserves for\\nvarious litigation and regulatory issues and a one-time cash bonus award to\\nemployees totaling $60 million, were partially offset by a favorable inventory\\nadjustment of $16 million. In 1992, insurance recoveries and chemical products\\nlicensing agreements of $76 million were partially offset by $11 million of net\\nadditions to reserves for various litigation and regulatory issues.\\n\\n                                  FS-5\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Results for 1994 were depressed by lower average crude\\noil and natural gas prices and lower sales margins on refined products. Crude\\noil prices were especially low in the first quarter and U.S. refined products\\nmargins were very weak in the second quarter. In addition to these industry\\nconditions, the company experienced unscheduled refinery downtime and other\\nrefinery operating problems in its U.S. operations, particularly in the first\\nhalf of the year, that further reduced earnings. Chemicals operations, however,\\nwere very strong, benefiting from improved industry fundamentals and the\\nrestructuring and cost reduction programs undertaken in recent years.\\n\\nIn 1993, compared with 1992, strong worldwide refined product sales margins and\\nhigh U.S. natural gas prices mitigated the effects of lower crude oil prices.\\nAnother contributing factor to the company\\'s improved operating performance in\\n1993 was the large reduction in its operating and administrative costs. Also,\\nlower interest and exploration expenses helped earnings. Chemicals operations\\nwere at depressed levels in both years, reflecting continued industry\\novercapacity and weak worldwide economies.\\n\\nSALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES were $35.1 billion, down from $36.2 billion\\nin 1993 and $38.2 billion in 1992. Revenues declined from 1993 and 1992 levels\\nprimarily due to lower prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products\\ntogether with lower refined product sales volumes. These factors also accounted\\nfor corresponding declines in PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS. The decline in\\ntotal revenues was partially mitigated by higher chemicals revenues and\\ngasoline excise tax collections.\\n\\nOTHER INCOME in all years included net gains resulting from the disposition of\\nnon-core assets, which caused other income to fluctuate from year to year.\\n\\nOPERATING, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, adjusted for special items,\\ndeclined $150 million in 1994. Annual operating costs in 1994 were over $1\\nbillion less than in 1991, the base measurement year set when the company\\nlaunched its cost reduction program in early 1992. Operating expenses in 1994\\nincluded unanticipated costs associated with unscheduled refinery shutdowns and\\nmaintenance, as well as other refinery operating problems. Although a portion\\nof the cost reduction is a result of operations disposed of over the years, the\\nbulk of the decrease is due to a significant reduction to the company\\'s ongoing\\ncost structure. Reported selling, general and administrative expenses in 1994\\nincluded the reversal of $319 million of accrued interest reserves on federal\\nincome taxes payable resulting from the company\\'s settlement with the IRS of\\nnine open tax years, 1979 through 1987.\\n\\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS                                1994        1993       1992\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nReported Operating Expenses*                     $6,314      $6,267     $6,145\\nReported Selling, General\\n  and Administrative Expenses                       963       1,530      1,761\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n Total Operational Costs                          7,277       7,797      7,906\\nEliminate Special Charges Before Tax               (161)       (531)      (282)\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n Adjusted Ongoing Operational Costs              $7,116      $7,266     $7,624\\n==============================================================================\\n* OPERATIONS ARE CHARGED AT MARKET RATES FOR CONSUMPTION OF THE COMPANY\\'S OWN\\n  FUEL. THESE \"COSTS\" ARE ELIMINATED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\\n  FOR COST PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT, SUCH COSTS ARE INCLUDED AND AMOUNTED TO\\n  $1,027, $1,017 AND $1,251 IN 1994, 1993 AND 1992, RESPECTIVELY.\\n\\nTAXES on income were $1.1 billion in 1994, $1.2 billion in 1993, and $1.3\\nbillion in 1992, equating to effective income tax rates of 39.6 percent, 47.9\\npercent, and 36.2 percent for each of the three years, respectively. The lower\\neffective tax rate for 1994 is attributable to the effect of favorable\\nprior-year tax adjustments resulting from a global settlement with the Internal\\nRevenue Service for the years 1979 through 1987, which included the reversal of\\nexcess interest reserves with little associated tax effect. The increase in the\\n1993 tax rate from 1992 levels is due primarily to unfavorable prior-year tax\\nadjustments, including an increase in deferred income taxes resulting from the\\none percent increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate. The 1992 rate\\nincluded the effect of a tax-free exchange, which resulted in a large book gain\\nwith no associated tax cost.\\n\\nCURRENCY TRANSACTIONS decreased net income $64 million in 1994 compared with\\nincreases of $46 million in 1993 and $90 million in 1992. These amounts include\\nthe company\\'s share of affiliates\\' currency transactions. The loss on currency\\ntransactions in 1994 resulted primarily from fluctuations in the value of the\\nAustralian and Philippine currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In 1993,\\ngains resulted from fluctuations in the currency of Nigeria. In 1992, gains\\nresulted from fluctuations in the currencies of the United Kingdom, Canada,\\nAustralia and Nigeria.\\n\\n                                  FS-6\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nRESULTS BY MAJOR OPERATING AREAS\\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS                                1994        1993       1992\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nExploration and Production\\n  United States                                  $  518      $  566     $1,043\\n  International                                     539         580        594\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Total Exploration and Production              1,057       1,146      1,637\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRefining, Marketing and Transportation\\n  United States                                      40        (170)       297\\n  International                                     239         252        111\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Total Refining, Marketing and Transportation    279          82        408\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Total Petroleum                               1,336       1,228      2,045\\nChemicals                                           206         143         89\\nCoal and Other Minerals                             111          44        198\\nCorporate and Other                                  40        (150)      (122)\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  Income Before Cumulative Effect\\n    of Changes in Accounting Principles          $1,693      $1,265     $2,210\\nCumulative Effect of Changes\\n    in Accounting Principles                          -

United Kingdom operations were impacted by weak\\nsales margins and the effects of an explosion and fire at the cracking facility\\nthat manufactures its gasoline. Shipping and trading earnings also declined. On\\nthe other hand, Canadian results improved on higher sales volumes and stronger\\nmarkets. Results in 1992 reflected weak global economic conditions that held\\ndown product prices, shrinking sales margins in all the company\\'s areas of\\noperations.\\n\\nSales volumes for 1994 increased slightly over 1993 levels as a 5 percent\\nincrease in marketing sales was mostly offset by a decline in the company\\'s\\ntrading sales volumes; however, 1994 volumes were up nearly 9 percent from 1992\\ndue to continued demand growth in the Caltex areas of operations. Caltex\\nvolumes, excluding transactions with Chevron, increased 4 percent from 1993 and\\n6 percent from 1992 to 1993, continuing its growth of the past several years.\\n\\nEquity earnings of Caltex were $210 million, $227 million and $180 million for\\n1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. Between 1994 and 1993, there was a\\nfavorable swing of $69 million resulting from inventory adjustments and an\\nunfavorable impact of $43 million caused by foreign currency transactions. In\\n1994, Chevron\\'s share of annual Caltex earnings benefited $17 million from\\nupward adjustments to the carrying value of its petroleum inventories to\\nreflect market values after a 1993 write-down of $52 million. Caltex foreign\\ncurrency transactions were losses of $27 million in 1994 but were gains of $16\\nmillion and $21 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.\\n\\nTotal international refining and marketing foreign currency transaction losses\\nwere $19 million in 1994, compared with gains of $2 million in 1993 and $13\\nmillion in 1992.\\n\\n                                  FS-9\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nCHEMICALS earnings, excluding special items, were up dramatically from 1993 and\\n1992 levels.

As a result, corporate and other charges for\\n1994 included $190 million that, under the previous method, would have been\\nallocated to the business segments. This change had no net income effect.\\nAmounts that would have been allocated in 1994 to the company\\'s major operating\\nareas under the prior method are as follows: U.S. Exploration and Production -\\n$34 million; U.S. Refining and Marketing - $32 million; International\\nExploration and Production - $63 million; International Refining and Marketing\\n- $48 million; Chemicals - $10 million; and Coal and Other Minerals - $3\\nmillion.\\n\\nHigher interest costs in 1994 resulted from the combined effect of higher debt\\nlevels and higher interest rates than in 1993. The decline in 1993 costs\\nrelative to 1992 reflects an $84 million after-tax reduction in interest\\nexpense, due to lower interest rates and lower debt levels.\\n\\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

The 1994\\ndecrease reflects lower operational earnings, adjusted for non-cash charges,\\nand increased working capital requirements, including the payment of $675\\nmillion to the Internal Revenue Service for the settlement of substantially all\\nopen tax issues for the nine\\n\\n                                  FS-10\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nyears 1979 through 1987. Cash from operations, proceeds from asset sales, an\\nincrease in overall debt levels and the draw-down of cash balances were used to\\nfund the company\\'s capital expenditures and dividend payments to stockholders.\\n\\nAT YEAR-END 1994, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIED $1.8 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS\\nAS LONG-TERM DEBT. Settlement of these obligations, consisting of commercial\\npaper, is not expected to require the use of working capital in 1995 because\\nthe company has the intent and the ability, as evidenced by revolving credit\\narrangements, to refinance them on a long-term basis. The company\\'s practice\\nhas been to continually refinance its commercial paper, maintaining levels it\\nbelieves to be appropriate.\\n\\nON DECEMBER 31, 1994, CHEVRON HAD $4.4 BILLION IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES\\nWITH VARIOUS MAJOR BANKS. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing\\nand can also be used for general credit requirements. No borrowings were\\noutstanding under these facilities during the year or at year-end 1994. In\\naddition, Chevron and one of its subsidiaries each have existing \"shelf\"\\nregistrations on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that together\\nwould permit registered offerings of up to approximately $700 million of debt\\nsecurities.\\n\\nTHE COMPANY\\'S DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS TOTALED $8.142 BILLION AT\\nDECEMBER 31, 1994, up $604 million from $7.538 billion at year-end 1993. The\\nincrease is primarily from $466 million of additional net short-term\\nborrowings, largely the issuance of commercial paper, the issuance of $350\\nmillion of 7.45 percent notes due in the year 2004 and $65 million in capital\\nlease obligations associated with the delivery of a new vessel. These increases\\nwere partially offset by the first quarter repayment of $200 million of 7.875\\npercent public debt originally due March 1, 1997. The company also retired $40\\nmillion of debt related to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan in January 1994.\\n\\nTHE COMPANY\\'S FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON ITS CAPITAL SPENDING\\nPROGRAM AND ITS BUSINESS OUTLOOK. While the company does not currently expect\\nits debt level to increase significantly during 1995, it believes it has\\nsubstantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements.\\n\\nFINANCIAL RATIOS\\n                                          1994      1993      1992\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCurrent Ratio                              0.8       0.8       0.9\\nInterest Coverage Ratio                    7.6       7.4       8.2\\nTotal Debt/Total Debt Plus Equity         35.8%     35.0%     36.4%\\n==================================================================\\n\\nThe CURRENT RATIO is the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at\\nyear-end.

These include the development of the Hibernia field off the coast of\\nNewfoundland; the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan; steam- and water-flood projects\\nin Indonesia; expansion of the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas project\\nin Australia; continued development of the Britannia natural gas field in the\\nNorth Sea; expanded production projects in Angola; field development and\\nexpanded exploration in Congo; new field development in Papua New Guinea; and\\nthe Norphlet Trend natural gas development project in the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\nRefining, marketing and transportation expenditures are estimated at about $1.9\\nbillion, with about $900 million of that planned for the U.S., including\\nupgrading U.S. refineries to produce reformulated gasolines needed to comply\\nwith the Clean Air Act and California Air Resources Board regulations. Most of\\nthe balance will be focused on high growth Asia Pacific Rim countries where the\\ncompany\\'s Caltex affiliate has several major refinery projects under way to\\nmeet rising demand, including continuing the construction of a new refinery in\\nThailand and capacity expansion projects in Japan and Korea.\\n\\nProjected spending also includes funds for the expansion of the linear\\nlow-density polyethylene manufacturing plant at the Cedar Bayou, Texas,\\nchemicals facility.\\n\\nCAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                                     1994                          1993                           1992\\n                                        ----------------------------- ----------------------------- -----------------------------\\n                                                    INTER-                        INTER-                         INTER-\\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS                        U.S.    NATIONAL     TOTAL    U.S.    NATIONAL     TOTAL    U.S.    NATIONAL     TOTAL\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n<S>                                     <C>        <C>        <C>     <C>        <C>        <C>     <C>        <C>        <C>\\nExploration and Production               $  807      $1,931    $2,738  $  763      $1,599    $2,362  $  792      $1,458    $2,250\\nRefining, Marketing and Transportation      885         890     1,775     949         748     1,697     962         749     1,711\\nChemicals                                   109          29       138     199          34       233     224          37       261\\nCoal and Other Minerals                      39          15        54      47          10        57      65          20        85\\nAll Other                                   114           -

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Chevron Corporation and its\\nconsolidated subsidiaries (the company) employ accounting policies that are in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\\n\\n\\nSUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES. The consolidated financial statements\\ninclude the accounts of subsidiary companies more than 50 percent owned.\\nInvestments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a\\nsubstantial ownership interest of approximately 20 to 50 percent, or for which\\nthe company participates in policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity\\nmethod. Under this accounting, remaining unamortized cost is increased or\\ndecreased by the company\\'s share of earnings or losses after dividends.\\n\\nOIL AND GAS ACCOUNTING. The successful efforts method of accounting is used for\\noil and gas exploration and production activities.\\n\\nDERIVATIVES. Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are\\nincluded in the carrying amounts of those assets or liabilities and are\\nultimately recognized in income as part of those carrying amounts. Gains and\\nlosses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated\\ntransactions also are deferred and are recognized in income or as adjustments\\nof carrying amounts when the hedged transaction occurs. Gains and losses on\\nderivatives contracts that do not qualify as hedges are recognized currently in\\n\"Other income.\"\\n\\nSHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. All short-term investments are classified as\\navailable-for-sale, and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those investments\\nthat are part of the company\\'s cash management portfolio with original\\nmaturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents. The\\nbalance of the short-term investments is reported as marketable securities.\\n\\n\\nINVENTORIES. Crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals and other merchandise are\\nstated at cost, using a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method. In the aggregate,\\nthese costs are below market. Materials and supplies generally are stated at\\naverage cost.\\n\\n\\nPROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. All costs for development wells, related plant\\nand equipment (including carbon dioxide and certain other injected materials\\nused in enhanced recovery projects), and mineral interests in oil and gas\\nproperties are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending\\ndetermination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that\\nare assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. All other exploratory wells\\nand costs are expensed.\\n\\nProved oil and gas properties are regularly assessed for possible impairment on\\nan aggregate worldwide portfolio basis, applying the informal \"ceiling test\" of\\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. Under this method, the possibility of\\nan impairment may exist if the aggregate net book carrying value of these\\nproperties, net of applicable deferred income taxes, exceeds the aggregate\\nundiscounted future cash flows, after tax, from the properties, as calculated\\nin accordance with accounting rules for supplemental information on oil and gas\\nproducing activities. In addition, high-cost, long-lead-time oil and gas\\nprojects are individually assessed prior to production start-up by comparing\\nthe recorded investment in the project with its fair market or economic value,\\nas appropriate. Economic values are generally based on management\\'s\\nexpectations of discounted future after-tax cash flows from the project at the\\ntime of assessment.\\n\\nDepreciation and depletion (including provisions for future abandonment and\\nrestoration costs) of all capitalized costs of proved oil and gas producing\\nproperties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production\\nmethod by individual fields as the proved developed reserves are produced.\\nDepletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are\\nrecognized using the unit-of-production method by individual fields as the\\nrelated proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation provisions for\\nimpairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.\\n\\nDepreciation and depletion expenses for coal are determined using the\\nunit-of-production method as the proved reserves are produced. The capitalized\\ncosts of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over\\nestimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to\\ndepreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method\\ngenerally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to\\namortize all capitalized leased assets.\\n\\nGains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant\\nand equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or\\nlosses from abnormal retirements or sales are included in income.\\n\\nExpenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities\\nin operating condition are expensed. Major replacements and renewals are\\ncapitalized.\\n\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES. Environmental expenditures that relate to current\\nongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed.\\nExpenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue\\ngeneration are capitalized.\\n\\nLiabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental\\nassessments and/or cleanups are probable, and the costs can be reasonably\\nestimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these\\naccruals is generally based on the company\\'s commitment to a formal plan of\\naction, such as an approved remediation plan or the sale or disposal of an\\nasset. For the company\\'s domestic marketing facilities, the accrual is based on\\nthe probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. For oil\\nand gas and coal producing properties, a provision is made through depreciation\\nexpense for anticipated abandonment and restoration costs at the end of the\\nproperty\\'s useful life.\\n\\nFor Superfund sites, the company records a liability for its share of costs\\nwhen it has been named as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) and when an\\nassessment or cleanup plan has been developed. This liability includes the\\ncompany\\'s own portion of the costs and also the company\\'s portion of amounts\\nfor\\n\\n                                  FS-18\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued\\n\\nother PRPs when it is probable that they will not be able to pay their share of\\nthe cleanup obligation.\\n\\nThe company records the gross amount of its liability based on its best\\nestimate of future costs in current dollars and using currently available\\ntechnology and applying current regulations as well as the company\\'s own\\ninternal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Probable\\nrecoveries or reimbursements are recorded as an asset.\\n\\n\\nCURRENCY TRANSLATION. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the\\ncompany\\'s consolidated operations as well as for substantially all operations\\nof its equity method companies. For those operations, all gains or losses from\\ncurrency transactions are included in income currently. The cumulative\\ntranslation effects for the few equity affiliates using functional currencies\\nother than the U.S. dollar are included in the currency translation adjustment\\nin stockholders\\' equity.\\n\\n\\nTAXES. Income taxes are accrued for retained earnings of international\\nsubsidiaries and corporate joint ventures intended to be remitted. Income taxes\\nare not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have\\nbeen, or are intended to be, reinvested indefinitely.\\n\\n\\nNOTE 2. ADOPTION OF STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 106,\\n\"EMPLOYERS\\' ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS\" (SFAS\\n106) AND NO. 109, \"ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\" (SFAS 109) Effective January 1,\\n1992, the company adopted SFAS 106 and SFAS 109, issued by the Financial\\nAccounting Standards Board. The effects of these statements on 1992 net income\\nincluded a charge of $641, or $.95 per share, attributable to the cumulative\\neffect of adoption, including the company\\'s share of equity affiliates. This\\nnet charge was composed of $833, after related tax benefits of $423, for the\\nrecognition of liabilities for retiree benefits (primarily health and life\\ninsurance), partially offset by a credit of $192 for deferred income tax\\nbenefits and other changes stipulated by the new income tax accounting rules.\\n\\n\\nNOTE 3.

The\\nestimated realizable value of the refineries took into account certain\\nenvironmental cleanup obligations. Also included in the reserve were amounts\\nfor environmental site assessments and employee severance. The refineries are\\nlocated in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Port Arthur, Texas.\\n\\nThe Philadelphia refinery was sold in August 1994 and the Port Arthur refinery\\nwas sold in February 1995. The reserve was reduced by the amount of proceeds\\nreceived from the sale of the Philadelphia refinery and adjustments were made\\nto reflect the terms of the sales. These included adjustments to the realizable\\nvalues of the assets, primarily inventories, and the recognition of certain\\nenvironmental remediation obligations retained by the company. These\\nadjustments resulted in a $45 net increase to the reserve. At year-end 1994,\\nthe reserve balance, before related tax effects, was composed of $491 for loss\\non the sale of the Port Arthur refinery and related inventories and $224 for\\nPort Arthur environmental cleanup obligations.\\n\\nThe company does not expect the environmental cleanup expenditures, most of\\nwhich will be made over an approximate\\n\\n                                  FS-19\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nNOTE 3.

INFORMATION RELATING TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The\\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes the following non-cash\\ntransactions:\\n\\nIn 1994, the company took delivery of a new tanker under a capital lease\\narrangement. This asset was recorded as a $65 million addition to properties,\\nplant and equipment and to capital lease obligations.\\n\\nThe company\\'s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) repaid $40 and $30 of\\nmatured debt guaranteed by Chevron Corporation in 1994 and 1993, respectively.\\nThe company reflected this payment as reductions in debt outstanding and in\\nDeferred Compensation - ESOP.\\n\\nIn 1993, the company acquired a 50 percent interest in the Tengizchevroil joint\\nventure (TCO) in the Republic of Kazakhstan through a series of cash and\\nnon-cash transactions. The company\\'s interest in TCO is accounted for using the\\nequity method of accounting and is recorded in \"Investments and advances\" in\\nthe consolidated balance sheet. The cash expended in connection with the\\nformation of TCO and subsequent advances to TCO have been included in the\\nconsolidated statement of cash flows in \"Capital expenditures.\" The deferred\\npayment portion of the TCO investment totaled $709 at December 31, 1993, and\\n$466 at year-end 1994 and is recorded in \"Accrued liabilities\" and \"Deferred\\ncredits and other non-current obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheet.\\nPayments in 1993 and 1994 related to the deferred portion of the TCO investment\\nwere classified as \"Repayments of long-term debt and other financing\\nobligations\" in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\\n\\nThe company refinanced an aggregate amount of $334 and $57 in tax exempt\\nlong-term debt and capital lease obligations in 1993 and 1992, respectively.\\nThese refinancings are not reflected in the consolidated statement of cash\\nflows.\\n\\nIn 1992, the company received 31,500,000 shares of its common stock held by a\\nstockholder in exchange for the stock of a subsidiary owning certain U.S. oil\\nand gas producing properties and related facilities, cash and other current\\nassets and current liabilities. The value attributed to the treasury shares\\nreceived was $1,100. The property exchanged consisted of properties, plant and\\nequipment with a carrying value of $790 and, excluding cash, net current\\nliabilities of $1. Cash of $57 was included as a reduction of proceeds from\\nasset sales.\\n\\nIn 1992, the company acquired an additional ownership interest in an affiliate,\\naccounted for under the equity method, in a non-cash transaction. This increase\\nin ownership required the consolidation of the affiliate into the company\\'s\\nfinancial statements. The principal result of this consolidation was to\\nincrease non-current assets and liabilities by approximately $64.\\n\\nThere have been other non-cash transactions that have occurred during the years\\npresented. These include the reissuance of treasury shares for management\\ncompensation plans; acquisitions of properties, plant and equipment through\\ncapital lease transactions; and changes in stockholders\\' equity, long-term debt\\nand other liabilities resulting from the accounting for the company\\'s ESOP.

The person or group who had acquired 10 percent or more of the\\noutstanding shares of common stock without the prior consent of the company\\nwould not be entitled to this purchase opportunity.\\n\\nThe Rights will expire in November 1998, or they may be redeemed by the company\\nat 5 cents per share prior to that date. The Rights do not have voting or\\ndividend rights and, until they become exercisable, have no dilutive effect on\\nthe earnings of the company. Twenty million shares of the company\\'s preferred\\nstock have been designated Series A participating preferred stock and reserved\\nfor issuance upon exercise of the Rights.\\n\\nNo event during 1994 made the Rights exercisable.\\n\\n\\nNOTE 6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\n\\nOFF BALANCE SHEET RISK. The company enters into forward exchange contracts,\\ngenerally with terms of 90 days or less, as a hedge against some of its foreign\\ncurrency exposures, primarily anticipated purchase transactions forecasted to\\noccur within 90 days. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the notional amounts were\\n$60 and $114, respectively.\\n\\nThe company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to\\nmanage the interest rate risk on its debt. Under the terms of the swaps, net\\ncash settlements, based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate\\ninterest amounts calculated by reference to agreed notional principal amounts,\\nare made either semi-annually or annually, and are recorded monthly as\\n\"Interest and debt expense.\" At December 31, 1994, the notional principal\\namounts of the swaps held by the company totaled $850, and the contracts have\\nremaining terms of between two to five years.\\n\\nThe impact of the swaps and forward exchange contracts on the company\\'s results\\nof operations is not material.\\n\\nThe company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments as hedges to\\nmanage a small portion of its exposure to price volatility stemming from its\\nintegrated petroleum activities. Relatively straightforward and involving\\nlittle complexity, these instruments consist mainly of crude oil futures\\ncontracts traded on the International Petroleum Exchange and natural gas swap\\ncontracts, entered into principally with major financial institutions. The\\nfutures contracts hedge anticipated crude oil purchases and sales, generally\\nforecasted to occur within a ninety-day period. Natural gas swaps are primarily\\nused to hedge firmly committed sales, and the terms of the swap contracts held\\nhave an average maturity of twelve months, mirroring the terms of the committed\\nsales. Gains and losses on the instruments offset, and are recognized\\nconcurrently with gains and losses associated with the underlying commodities.\\n\\n\\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. The company\\'s financial instruments that are\\nexposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash\\nequivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade\\nreceivables.\\n\\nThe company\\'s short-term investments are placed with various foreign\\ngovernments and a wide array of financial institutions with high credit\\nratings. This diversified investment policy limits the company\\'s exposure both\\nto credit risk and to concentration of credit risk. Similar standards of\\ndiversity and creditworthiness are applied to the company\\'s counterparties in\\nderivative financial instruments.\\n\\nThe trade receivable balances, reflecting the company\\'s diversified sources of\\nrevenue, are dispersed among the company\\'s broad customer base worldwide. As a\\nconsequence, concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely\\nassesses the financial strength of its customers. Letters of credit are the\\nprincipal security obtained to support lines of credit or negotiated contracts\\nwhen the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient.\\n\\n\\nFAIR VALUE. At December 31, 1994, the company\\'s long-term debt of $2,155 had an\\nestimated fair value of $2,127. The fair value is based on quoted market prices\\nat December 31, 1994, or the present value of expected cash flows when a quoted\\nmarket price was not available.\\n\\nAt December 31, 1994, the company held crude oil futures contracts and natural\\ngas swap contracts with approximate negative fair values totaling $(38).\\n\\nThe company holds cash equivalents and U.S. dollar marketable securities in\\ndomestic and offshore portfolios. Eurodollar bonds and floating rate notes are\\nthe primary instruments held. At December 31, 1994, cash equivalents and\\nmarketable securities had a fair value of $1,178. Of this balance, $285\\nclassified as cash equivalents had average maturities under 90 days, while the\\nremainder, classified as marketable securities, had an average maturity of 4\\nyears.\\n\\n\\nNOTE 7.

Identifiable assets at\\nDecember 31, 1994 for U.S. and International Petroleum were reduced $630 and\\n$506, respectively. The effect of these changes on 1994 operating income and\\nyear-end 1994 identifiable assets of the company\\'s other segments and\\ngeographic areas was not material.\\n\\nIdentifiable assets for the business segments include all assets associated\\nwith operations in the indicated geographic areas, including investments in\\naffiliates.\\n\\nSales and other operating revenues for the petroleum segment are derived from\\nthe production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, and\\nfrom the refining and marketing of petroleum products. The company also obtains\\nrevenues from the transportation and trading of crude oil and refined products.\\nChemicals revenues result primarily from the sale of petrochemicals, plastic\\nresins, and lube oil and fuel additives. Coal and other minerals revenues\\nrelate primarily to coal sales. During 1994, the company completed its\\nwithdrawal from non-coal minerals activities.\\n\\nSales and other operating revenues in the above table include both sales to\\nunaffiliated customers and sales from the transfer of products between\\nsegments. Sales from the transfer of products between segments and geographic\\nareas are generally at estimated market prices. Transfers between geographic\\nareas are presented as memo items below the table.\\n\\nEquity in earnings of affiliated companies has been associated with the\\nsegments in which the affiliates operate. Sales to the Caltex Group are\\nincluded in the \"International Petroleum\" segment. Information on the Caltex\\nand Tengizchevroil affiliates is presented in Note 11. Other affiliates are\\neither not material or not vertically integrated with a segment\\'s operations.\\n\\n\\nNOTE 10.

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS The U.S. federal income\\ntax and California franchise tax liabilities of the company have been settled\\nthrough 1976 and 1987, respectively. For federal income tax purposes, all\\nissues other than the allocation of state income taxes and the creditability of\\ntaxes paid to the Government of Indonesia have been resolved through 1987. The\\nIndonesia issue applies only to years after 1982. Settlement of open tax\\nmatters is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated net\\nassets or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate\\nprovision has been made for income and franchise taxes for all years either\\nunder examination or subject to future examination.\\n\\nAt December 31, 1994, the company and its subsidiaries, as direct or indirect\\nguarantors, had contingent liabilities of $249 for notes of affiliated\\ncompanies and $55 for notes of others.\\n\\nThe company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with\\nrespect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments,\\nthroughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to\\nsuppliers\\' financing arrangements. The aggregate amount of required payments\\nunder these various commitments are: 1995-$141; 1996-$137; 1997-$102; 1998-$89;\\n1999-$86; 2000 and after-$497. Total payments under the agreements were $154 in\\n1994, $142 in 1993 and $128 in 1992.\\n\\nIn March 1992, an agency within the Department of Energy (DOE) issued a\\nProposed Remedial Order (PRO) claiming Chevron failed to comply with DOE\\nregulations in the course of its participation in the Tertiary Incentive\\nProgram. Although the DOE regulations involved were rescinded in March 1981,\\nfollowing decontrol of crude oil prices in January 1981, and the statute\\nauthorizing the regulations expired in September 1981, the PRO purports to be\\nfor the period April 1980 through April 1990. The PRO claimed the company\\noverrecouped under the regulations by $125 during the period in question.\\nIncluding interest through December 1994, the total claim amounted to $295. The\\nDOE is seeking to increase the claim by an additional $42, plus interest, of\\nalleged over-recovery. The company asserts that in fact it incurred a loss\\nthrough participation in the DOE program. Discovery has been completed and\\nevidentiary hearings are in progress before the Office of Hearings and Appeals.\\n\\nThe company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and\\nregulations that in the future may require the company to take action to\\ncorrect or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or\\nrelease of chemical or petroleum substances by the company or other parties.\\nSuch contingencies may exist for various sites including, but not limited to:\\nSuperfund sites and refineries, oil fields, service stations, terminals and\\nland development areas, whether operating, closed or sold. The amount of such\\nfuture cost is indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of\\npossible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions\\nthat may be required, the determination of the company\\'s liability in\\nproportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are\\nrecoverable from third parties. While the company provides for known\\nenvironmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the\\namount of future costs may be material to results of operations in the period\\nin which they are recognized.\\n\\nThe company\\'s operations, particularly oil and gas exploration and production,\\ncan be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in\\nthe various countries, including the United States, in which it operates. In\\ncertain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and\\ntaxes, and, in others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the\\nsafety of employees and the company\\'s continued presence in those countries.\\nInternal unrest or strained relations between a host government and the company\\nor other governments may affect the company\\'s operations. Those developments\\nhave, at times, significantly affected the company\\'s related operations and\\nresults, and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level\\nof current and future activity in such countries.\\n\\nAreas in which the company has significant operations include the United\\nStates, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, Angola, Congo, Papua New\\nGuinea, China, Indonesia and Zaire. The company\\'s Caltex affiliates have\\nsignificant operations in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Australia, the Philippines,\\nThailand and South Africa.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO\\n          PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES\\n\\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the\\nabove proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the\\nrequirements of SFAS 69. Estimated future cash inflows from production are\\ncomputed by applying year-end prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities of\\nestimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are limited to those\\nprovided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting\\nyear. Future development and production costs are those estimated future\\nexpenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end estimated proved\\nreserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end\\neconomic conditions. Estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying\\nappropriate year-end statutory tax rates. These rates reflect allowable\\ndeductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pre-tax net\\ncash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. Discounted future net cash\\nflows are calculated using 10 percent midperiod discount factors. This\\ndiscounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when the future expenditures\\nwill be incurred and when the reserves will be produced.\\n\\nThe information provided does not represent management\\'s estimate of the\\ncompany\\'s expected future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves.\\nEstimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as\\nnew information becomes available. Moreover, probable and possible reserves,\\nwhich may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The\\narbitrary valuation prescribed under SFAS 69 requires assumptions as to the\\ntiming of future production from proved reserves and the timing and amount of\\nfuture development and production costs. The calculations are made as of\\nDecember 31 each year and should not be relied upon as an indication of the\\ncompany\\'s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves.\\n\\n                                  FS-34\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES -

The Group is comprised of the following companies:\\n\\n-   Caltex Petroleum Corporation, a company incorporated in Delaware, that\\n    through its many subsidiaries and affiliates, conducts refining, marketing\\n    and transporting activities in the Eastern Hemisphere;\\n\\n-   P. T. Caltex Pacific Indonesia, an exploration and production company\\n    incorporated and operating in Indonesia;\\n\\n-   American Overseas Petroleum Limited, a company incorporated in the Bahamas,\\n    that, through its subsidiaries, manages certain exploration and production\\n    operations in Indonesia in which Chevron and Texaco have interests, but not\\n    necessarily jointly or in the same properties.\\n\\nA brief description of each company\\'s operations and the Group\\'s environmental\\nactivities follows:\\n\\n\\nCaltex Petroleum Corporation (Caltex)\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nThrough its subsidiaries and affiliates, Caltex operates in 61 countries with\\nsome of the highest economic and petroleum growth rates in the world,\\nprincipally in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, New Zealand and Australia. \\nCertain refining and marketing operations are conducted through joint ventures,\\nwith equity interests in 14 refineries in 11 countries.  Caltex\\' share of\\nrefinery inputs approximated 920,000 barrels per day in 1994.  Caltex continues\\nto improve its refineries with investments designed to provide higher yields\\nand meet environmental regulations.  Construction of a new 130,000 barrels per\\nday refinery in Thailand is progressing with completion anticipated in 1996. \\nAt year end 1994, Caltex had over 8,000 employees, of which about 3% were\\nlocated in the United States.\\n\\nWith a strong presence in its principal operating areas, Caltex has an average\\nmarket share of 17.4% with refined product sales of approximately 1.3 million\\nbarrels per day in 1994.  Caltex built 119 new branded retail outlets during\\n1994 and refurbished 177 existing locations in its aim to upgrade its retail\\ndistribution network.\\n\\nCaltex conducts international crude oil and refined product logistics and\\ntrading operations from a subsidiary in Singapore.  Other offices are located\\nin London, Dallas, Capetown, Bahrain and Tokyo.  The company has an interest in\\na fleet of vessels and owns or has equity interests in numerous pipelines,\\nterminals and depots.  Currently, Caltex is active in the petrochemical\\nbusiness, particularly in Japan and South Korea.\\n\\nP. T. Caltex Pacific Indonesia (CPI)\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nCPI holds a Production Sharing Contract in Central Sumatra for which the\\nIndonesian government granted an extension to the year 2021 during 1992.  CPI\\nalso acts as operator for four other petroleum contract areas in Sumatra, which\\nare jointly held by Chevron and Texaco.  Exploration is pursued through an area\\ncomprising 2.446 million acres with production established in the giant Minas\\nand Duri fields, along with more than 80 smaller fields.  Gross production from\\nfields operated by CPI for 1994 was 718,000 barrels per day.  CPI entitlements\\nare sold to its shareholders, who use it in their systems or sell it to third\\nparties.  At year end 1994, CPI had over 6,400 employees, all located in\\nIndonesia.\\n\\n                                      C-3\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                           CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n                              GENERAL INFORMATION\\n\\n\\nAmerican Overseas Petroleum Limited (AOPL)\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn addition to coordinating the CPI activities, AOPL, through its subsidiary\\nAmoseas Indonesia Inc., manages Texaco\\'s and Chevron\\'s undivided interest\\nholdings which include ten contract areas in Indonesia, excluding Sumatra.  Oil\\nproduction is currently established in two contract areas, while exploration\\nwas being pursued in seven others.  Before year end 1994, two of those seven\\nexploration areas had been relinquished.  The remaining area is in Darajat,\\nWest Java, which contains geothermal reserves sufficient to supply a 55-\\nmegawatt power generating plant for over 30 years.  Production of the\\ngeothermal reserves began in 1994 and amounted to 62,185,795 KWH.  AOPL\\'s 1994\\nshare of crude oil production amounted to 18,600 barrels per day.  At year end,\\nAOPL had 254 employees, of which about 13% were located in the United States.\\n\\nEnvironmental Activities\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe Group\\'s activities are subject to environmental, health and safety\\nregulations in each of the countries in which it operates.  Such regulations\\nvary significantly in degree of scope, standards and enforcement.  The Group\\'s\\npolicy is to comply with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws\\nand regulations.  The Group has an active program to ensure its environmental\\nstandards are maintained, which includes closely monitoring applicable\\nstatutory and regulatory requirements, as well as enforcement policies, in each\\nof the countries in which it operates, and conducting periodic environmental\\ncompliance audits.  At December 31, 1994, the Group had accrued $12 million for\\nvarious remediation activities.  The environmental guidelines and definitions\\npromulgated by the American Petroleum Institute provide the basis for reporting\\nthe Group\\'s expenditures.  For the year ended December 31, 1994, the Group,\\nincluding its equity share of nonsubsidiary companies, incurred capital costs\\nof $233 million and nonremediation related operating expenses of $132 million. \\nThe major component of the Group\\'s expenditures is for the prevention of air\\npollution. In addition, as of December 31, 1994, reserves relative to the\\nfuture cost of restoring and abandoning existing oil and gas properties were\\n$27 million. Based upon existing statutory and regulatory requirements,\\ninvestment and operating plans and known exposures, the Group believes\\nenvironmental expenditures will not materially affect its liquidity, financial\\nposition or results of operations.\\n\\n\\n                                      C-4\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                           INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\\' REPORT\\n                           ----------------------------\\n\\n\\nTO THE STOCKHOLDERS\\nTHE CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES:\\n\\nWe have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of the Caltex Group of\\nCompanies as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related combined statements\\nof income, retained earnings, and cash flows for each of the years in the\\nthree-year period ended December 31, 1994.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n\\n\\n     PRINCIPLES OF COMBINATION\\n\\nThe combined financial statements of the Caltex Group of Companies (Group)\\ninclude the accounts of Caltex Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries, American\\nOverseas Petroleum Limited and subsidiary and P.T. Caltex Pacific Indonesia\\nafter the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.  A subsidiary\\nof Chevron Corporation and two subsidiaries of Texaco Inc. (stockholders) each\\nown 50% of the outstanding common shares.  The Group is primarily engaged in\\nexploring, producing, refining and marketing crude oil and refined products in\\nthe Eastern Hemisphere.  The Group employs accounting policies that are in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\\n\\n\\n     TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES\\n\\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all principal subsidiary\\noperations.  Nonsubsidiary companies in Japan and Korea use the local currency\\nas the functional currency.\\n\\n\\n     INVENTORIES\\n\\nCrude oil and refined product inventories are stated at the lower of cost\\n(primarily determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method) or current\\nmarket value.  Costs include applicable purchase and refining costs, duties,\\nimport taxes, freight, etc.  Materials and supplies are valued at average cost.\\n\\n\\n     INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES\\n\\nInvestments in and advances to nonsubsidiary companies in which 20% to 50% of\\nthe voting stock is owned by the Group, or in which the Group has the ability\\nto exercise significant influence, are accounted for by the equity method. \\nUnder this method, the Group\\'s equity in the earnings or losses of these\\ncompanies is included in current results, and the related investments reflect\\nthe equity in the book value of underlying net assets.  Investments in other\\nnonsubsidiary companies are carried at cost and related dividends are reported\\nas income.\\n\\n\\n     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\\n\\nExploration and production activities are accounted for under the \"successful\\nefforts\" method.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses for\\ncapitalized costs relating to the producing area, including intangible\\ndevelopment costs, are computed using the unit-of-production method.\\n\\nAll other assets are depreciated by class on a uniform straight-line basis. \\nDepreciation rates are based upon the estimated useful life of each class of\\nproperty.\\n\\nMaintenance and repairs necessary to maintain facilities in operating condition\\nare charged to income as incurred.  Additions and betterments that materially\\nextend the life of properties are capitalized.  Upon disposal of properties,\\nany net gain or loss is included in other income.\\n\\n                                      C-10\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                           CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                    NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED\\n\\n\\n     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\\n\\nCompliance with environmental regulations is determined in consideration of the\\nexisting laws in each of the countries in which the Group operates and the\\nGroup\\'s own internal standards.  The Group capitalizes expenditures that create\\nfuture benefits or contribute to future revenue generation.  Remediation costs\\nare accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposure even if\\nuncertainties exist about the ultimate cost of the remediation.  Such accruals\\nare based on the best available nondiscounted estimated costs using data\\ndeveloped by third party experts.  Costs of environmental compliance for past\\nand ongoing operations, including maintenance and monitoring, are expensed as\\nincurred.  Recoveries from third parties are recorded as assets when\\nrealization is determined to be probable.\\n\\n\\n(2)  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\\n\\nThe Group adopted SFAS No. 106 \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postretirement\\nBenefits Other Than Pensions\" effective January 1, 1992, using the immediate\\nrecognition option.  SFAS No. 106 requires accrual, during the employees\\'\\nservice with the Group, of the cost of their retiree health and life insurance\\nbenefits.  Prior to 1992, postretirement benefits were included in expense as\\nthe benefits were paid.  The adoption of SFAS No. 106 resulted in a cumulative\\nafter-tax charge of $26 million.\\n\\nEffective January 1, 1992, deferred income taxes are recognized according to\\nthe asset and liability method specified in Statement of Financial Accounting\\nStandards (SFAS) No. 109 \"Accounting for Income Taxes\" by applying individual\\njurisdiction tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the\\nfinancial statement and tax basis carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. \\nThe effect of tax rate changes on previously recorded deferred taxes is\\nrecognized in the current year.  The adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted in a\\ncumulative benefit of $77 million.\\n\\nEffective January 1, 1994, the Group adopted SFAS No. 112 \"Employers\\'\\nAccounting for Postemployment Benefits.\"  SFAS No. 112 requires companies to\\naccrue for the cost for benefits provided to former or inactive employees after\\nemployment but prior to retirement.  Adoption of this standard did not\\nmaterially impact the combined financial statements of the Group.\\n\\nThe Group adopted SFAS No. 115 \"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and\\nEquity Securities\" effective January 1, 1994.  SFAS No. 115 requires that\\ninvestments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and\\nall investments in debt securities be classified into three categories based on\\nmanagement\\'s intent.  Such investments are to be reported at fair value except\\nfor debt securities intended to be held to maturity which are to be reported at\\namortized cost.  Previously, all such investments were accounted for at\\namortized cost.  The cumulative effect of this change at January 1, 1994  was\\nan increase in stockholders\\' equity of $70 million, after related taxes,\\nrepresenting unrealized net gains applicable to securities categorized as\\navailable-for-sale under the new standard. Such securities are primarily held\\nby nonsubsidiary companies accounted for by the equity method.\\n\\n                                      C-11\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                           CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                    NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)  INVENTORIES\\n\\nThe excess of current cost over the stated value of inventory maintained on the\\nLIFO basis was approximately $56 million and $40 million at December 31, 1994\\nand 1993, respectively.\\n\\nDuring 1994, 1993 and 1992, inventory quantities maintained on the LIFO basis\\nwere reduced at certain locations.  The inventory reductions resulted in a\\ndecrease in the earnings of consolidated subsidiaries and nonsubsidiary\\ncompanies at equity of approximately $12 million and $2 million in 1994 and\\n1992, respectively, and an increase in earnings of $1 million in 1993.\\n\\nCharges of $104 million reduced income in 1993 to reflect a market value of\\ncertain inventories lower than their LIFO carrying value.  Earnings of $34\\nmillion and $14 million were recorded in 1994 and 1992, respectively, to\\nreflect a partial recovery of prior year charges.\\n\\n\\n(4)  NONSUBSIDIARY COMPANIES AT EQUITY\\n\\nInvestments in and advances to nonsubsidiary companies at equity at December 31\\ninclude the following (in millions):\\n\\n                                           Equity Share        1994       1993\\n                                           ------------     -------    -------\\n\\nNippon Petroleum Refining Company, Ltd.        50%           $  997     $  829\\nKoa Oil Company, Ltd.                          50%              448        310\\nHonam Oil Refinery Company, Ltd.               50%              557        423\\nAll other                                    Various            368        234\\n                                                            -------    -------\\n                                                             $2,370     $1,796\\n                                                            =======    =======\\n\\nShown below is summarized combined financial information for these\\nnonsubsidiary companies (in millions):\\n\\n                                            100%               Equity Share\\n                                     ------------------     ------------------\\n                                        1994       1993        1994       1993 \\n\\n                                     -------    -------     -------    -------\\nCurrent assets                        $5,352     $4,680      $2,651     $2,316\\nOther assets                           7,821      6,147       3,858      2,975\\n\\nCurrent liabilities                    4,940      4,900       2,363      2,349\\nOther liabilities                      3,504      2,306       1,776      1,146\\nNet worth                              4,729      3,621       2,370      1,796\\n\\n\\n                                     100%                  Equity Share\\n                         -------------------------   -------------------------\\n                            1994     1993     1992      1994     1993     1992\\n                         -------------------------   -------------------------\\nOperating revenues       $10,886  $10,679  $10,502    $5,418   $5,304   $5,216\\nOperating income             770      494      645       381      242      319\\nNet income                   526      281      326       263      140      163\\n\\n                                      C-12\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                           CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                    NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n(4)  NONSUBSIDIARY COMPANIES AT EQUITY - CONTINUED\\n\\nRetained earnings at December 31, 1994, includes $1.4 billion representing the\\nGroup\\'s share of undistributed earnings of nonsubsidiary companies at equity.\\n\\nCash dividends received from these nonsubsidiary companies were $43 million,\\n$37 million, and $30 million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. \\n\\nSales to the other 50 percent owner of Nippon Petroleum Refining Company, Ltd.\\nof products refined by Nippon Petroleum Refining Company, Ltd. and Koa Oil\\nCompany, Ltd. were approximately $2 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2 billion in\\n1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.\\n\\n\\n(5)  NOTES PAYABLE\\n\\nShort-term financing consists primarily of demand loans, promissory notes,\\nacceptance credits and overdrafts.

After removal to Federal District Court\\nin Houston, the litigation\\'s disposition turned on questions of federal court\\njurisdiction and whether the case should be dismissed for forum non conveniens.\\nThe plaintiffs\\' petition purported to be a class action on behalf of at least\\n3,350 parties, who were either survivors of, or next of kin of persons deceased\\nin a collision in Philippine waters on December 20, 1987.  One vessel involved\\nin the collision was carrying Group products in connection with a freight\\ncontract.  Although the Group had no direct or indirect ownership in or\\noperational responsibility for either vessel, various theories of liability\\nwere alleged against the Group.  No specific monetary recovery was sought\\nalthough the petition contained a variety of demands for various categories of\\ncompensatory as well as punitive damages.  These issues were resolved in the\\nGroup\\'s favor by the Federal District Court in March 1992, through a forum non\\nconveniens dismissal, and that decision is now final.  Subsequent to that\\ndismissal, but consistent with its terms, cases were filed against the Group\\nentities in the Philippine courts (over and above those previously filed there\\nsubsequent to the collision, all of which are in various stages of litigation\\nand are being vigorously resisted).  However, and notwithstanding the Houston\\nFederal District Court dismissal, the plaintiffs filed another lawsuit,\\nalleging the same causes of action as in the Texas litigation, in Louisiana\\nState Court in New Orleans.  The Group removed that case to Federal District\\nCourt in New Orleans from which it was remanded back to Louisiana State Court. \\nThe Group then sought injunctive and other relief from the Federal District\\nCourt in Houston in order to ensure that that Court\\'s previous dismissal would\\nbe given proper effect.  On having its request for relief denied, the Group\\nthen filed an expedited appeal to the U. S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. \\nThat Court\\'s ruling is expected shortly.  Management is contesting this case\\nvigorously.  It is not possible to estimate the amount of damages involved, if\\nany.\\n\\nThe Group may be subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws\\nand regulations in each of the countries in which it operates that, in the\\nfuture, may require the Group to take action to correct or remediate the\\neffects on the environment of prior disposal or release of petroleum substances\\nby the Group.  The amount of such future cost is indeterminable due to such\\nfactors as the nature of the new regulations, the unknown magnitude of any\\npossible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions\\nthat may be required, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from\\nthird party insurance.\\n\\n                                      C-15\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                           CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                    NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n(9)  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - CONTINUED\\n\\nThe Group is also involved in certain other litigation and Internal Revenue\\nService tax audits that could involve significant payments if such items are\\nall ultimately resolved adversely to the Group.\\n\\nWhile it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability\\nwith respect to the above mentioned contingent liabilities, the aggregate\\namount that may arise from such liabilities is not anticipated to be material\\nin relation to the Group\\'s combined financial position, results of operations,\\nor liquidity.\\n\\nUnconditional purchase obligations in 1992 and 1993 were not considered\\nmaterial.  However, in April 1994, a Group subsidiary entered into a\\ncontractual commitment, effective October 1996, for a period of eleven years,\\nto purchase refined products in conjunction with the financing of a refinery\\nthat is presently under construction by a nonsubsidiary company.  Total future\\nestimated commitments (in billions) for the Group under this and other similar\\ncontracts, based on current pricing and projected growth rates, are: 1995 -\\n$.6, 1996 - $.9, 1997 - $1.1, 1998 - $1.3, 1999 - $1.5, and 2000 to expiration\\nof contracts - $9.6.  Purchases (in billions) under similar contracts were $.5,\\n$.6, and $.4 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.\\n\\nThe Group is in the process of finalizing sales of certain property required by\\na local government.  The Group will be compensated for the value of the\\nproperty transferred and the cost of replacing operating assets affected by the\\ntransfer.  While the compensation is to be fully utilized in the reconstruction\\nprogram over a five year period, the excess of the compensation over the net\\nbook value of the property and the dismantled operating assets will be\\nrecognized in earnings in early 1995.  The impact to the Group\\'s earnings is\\ncurrently estimated to be a net after-tax gain of approximately $155 million.\\n\\n\\n(10)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\n\\nCertain Group companies are parties to financial instruments with off-balance\\nsheet credit and market risk, principally interest rate risk.  As of\\nDecember 31, the Group had commitments outstanding for interest rate swaps and\\nforeign currency transactions for which the notional or contractual amounts are\\nas follows (in millions):\\n\\n                                                               1994       1993\\n                                                            -------    -------\\nInterest rate swaps - Pay Fixed, Receive Floating              $363       $294\\nInterest rate swaps - Pay Floating, Receive Fixed              $182       $ 50\\nCommitments to purchase foreign currencies                     $252       $244\\nCommitments to sell foreign currencies                         $274       $183\\n\\n\\nThe Group enters into interest rate swaps in managing its interest rate risk,\\nand their effects are recognized in the statement of income at the same time as\\nthe interest expense on the debt to which they relate.  The swap contracts have\\nremaining maturities up to eight years.  The fair values of these swaps are not\\nmaterial.\\n\\nThe Group enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge against some of its\\nforeign currency exposure stemming from existing liabilities and firm\\ncommitments.  Forward exchange contracts hedging existing liabilities have\\nmaturities of up to seven years, and those contracts hedging firm commitments\\nhave maturities of under a year.  Gains and losses on the forward exchange\\ncontracts are recognized in income concurrent with the income recognition of\\nthe underlying hedged transaction.  The fair values of these forward exchange\\ncontracts are not material.\\n\\n                                      C-16\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                           CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                    NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n(10) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CONTINUED\\n\\nThe Group\\'s activity in commodity-based derivative contracts, that must be\\nsettled in cash, is not material.\\n\\nThe Group\\'s long-term debt, excluding capital lease obligations, of $704\\nmillion and $497 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, had fair\\nvalues of $696 million and $511 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993,\\nrespectively. The fair value estimates were based on the present value of\\nexpected cash flows discounted at current market rates for similar obligations.\\nThe reported amounts of financial instruments such as cash and cash\\nequivalents, notes and accounts receivable, and all current liabilities\\napproximate fair value because of their short maturity.\\n\\nAt December 31, 1994, the Group had investments in debt securities available-\\nfor-sale and debt securities held to maturity at amortized costs of $63 million\\n(maturity less than ten years) and $77 million (maturity less than one\\nyear), respectively.  The fair value of these securities approximates amortized\\ncosts.  The investment in marketable equity securities is not material.  At\\nDecember 31, 1994, the Group\\'s carrying amount for investments in nonsubsidiary\\ncompanies accounted for at equity included $83 million for net-of-tax\\nunrealized net gains on investments held by these nonsubsidiaries.\\n\\nCertain Group companies were contingently liable as guarantors for $2 million\\nand $7 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Group also had\\ncommitments of $99 million and $36 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993,\\nrespectively, in the form of letters of credit which have been issued on behalf\\nof Group companies to facilitate either the Group\\'s or other parties\\' ability\\nto trade in the normal course of business.  In addition, the Group is\\ncontingently liable at December 31, 1994, for a maximum of $192 million, to a\\nnonsubsidiary for precompletion sponsor support of its project finance\\nobligations.\\n\\nThe Group is exposed to credit risks in the event of non-performance by\\ncounterparties to financial instruments.  For financial instruments with\\ninstitutions, the Group does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet their\\nobligations given their high credit ratings.  Other financial instruments\\nexposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables.  These\\nreceivables are  dispersed among the countries in which the Group operates,\\nthus limiting concentrations of such risk.\\n\\nThe Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally\\ndoes not require collateral.  Letters of credit are the principal security\\nobtained to support lines of credit when the financial strength of a customer\\nor country is not considered sufficient.  Credit losses have been historically\\nwithin management\\'s expectations.\\n\\n\\n(11) TAXES\\n\\nTaxes charged to income consist of the following (in millions):\\n\\n                                                   1994        1993       1992\\n                                                -------     -------    -------\\nTaxes other than income taxes:\\n  Duties, import and excise taxes                $2,384      $1,978     $1,891\\n  Other                                              32          29         29\\n                                                -------     -------    -------\\nTotal taxes other than income taxes               2,416       2,007      1,920\\n  Provision for income taxes                        422         458        509\\n                                                -------     -------    -------\\n                                                 $2,838      $2,465     $2,429\\n                                                =======     =======    =======\\n\\n                                      C-17\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                           CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                    NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n(11) TAXES - CONTINUED\\n\\nThe provision for income taxes, substantially all foreign, has been computed on\\nan individual company basis at rates in effect in the various countries of\\noperation.

BUSINESS\\n\\n  (a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS\\n\\nSUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON\\n- ------------------------------\\nChevron Corporation (1), a Delaware corporation, is a major international oil\\ncompany. It provides administrative, financial and management support for,\\nand manages its investments in, domestic and foreign subsidiaries and\\naffiliates, which engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemical\\noperations, real estate development and other mineral and energy related\\nactivities in the United States and approximately 100 other countries.\\nPetroleum operations consist of exploring for, developing and producing crude\\noil and natural gas; transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum\\nproducts by pipelines, marine vessels and motor equipment; refining crude oil\\ninto finished petroleum products; and marketing crude oil, natural gas and the\\nmany products derived from petroleum. Chemical operations include the\\nmanufacture and marketing of a wide range of chemicals for industrial uses.\\n\\nIncorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the\\ncompany adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984. Domestic integrated\\npetroleum operations are conducted primarily through three divisions of the\\ncompany\\'s wholly owned Chevron U.S.A. Inc. subsidiary. Exploration and\\nproduction operations in the United States are carried out through Chevron\\nU.S.A. Production Company. U.S. refining and marketing activities are\\nperformed by Chevron U.S.A. Products Company. Warren Petroleum Company\\nengages in all phases of the domestic natural gas liquids business. A list\\nof the company\\'s major subsidiaries is presented on page 40 of this Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 1993, Chevron had 47,576 employees,\\n78 percent of whom were employed in U.S. operations.\\n\\n\\nOVERVIEW OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY\\n- ------------------------------\\nPetroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by a large\\nnumber of factors, over some of which individual oil and gas companies have\\nlittle control. Governmental attitudes and policies, particularly in the\\nareas of taxation, energy and the environment, have a significant impact on\\npetroleum activities, regulating where and how companies conduct their\\noperations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limiting their\\nprofits directly. Prices for crude oil and natural gas, petroleum products\\nand petrochemicals are determined by supply and demand for these commodities.\\nOPEC member countries are the world\\'s swing producers of crude oil and their\\nproduction levels are the primary driver in determining worldwide supply.\\nDemand for crude oil and its products is largely driven by the health of\\nlocal, national and worldwide economies, although weather patterns and\\ntaxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part.\\nNatural gas is generally produced and consumed on a country or regional\\nbasis. Its largest use is for electrical generation, where it competes with\\nother energy fuels.\\n\\nCURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\\n- -----------------------------\\nCrude oil prices rose slightly in the first quarter of 1993 and remained\\nsteady through the second quarter before trending downward for the remainder\\nof the year. The decline was particularly prominent during the last two\\nmonths of 1993, with prices reaching their lowest level in five years by year\\nend. The weak global economy has dampened the demand for petroleum and\\npetroleum related products. Increased production from non-OPEC countries,\\nparticularly from the North Sea, and OPEC\\'s failure to adjust their\\nproduction levels accordingly has further exacerbated the decline in crude\\noil prices. Partially mitigating the effects of\\n\\n- ------------------\\n(1)  As used in this report, the term \"Chevron\" and such terms as \"the\\n     company,\" \"the corporation,\" \"our,\" \"we,\" and \"us\" may refer to Chevron\\n     Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or to all of\\n     them taken as a whole, but unless the context clearly indicates\\n     otherwise, should not be read to include \"affiliates\" of Chevron\\n     (those companies owned approximately 50 percent or less).\\n\\n     As used in this report, the term \"Caltex\" may refer to the Caltex Group\\n     of companies, any one company of the group, any of their consolidated\\n     subsidiaries, or to all of them taken as a whole and also includes the\\n     \"affiliates\" of Caltex.\\n\\n     All of these terms are used for convenience only, and are not intended\\n     as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which\\n     manages its own affairs.\\n\\n                                     - 1 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nlower crude oil prices were higher natural gas prices. Unseasonable weather\\npatterns, low gas storage levels, the loss of three nuclear power plants in\\nthe Southeast for a portion of the year, and the environmentally preferred\\nattributes of natural gas all contributed to the stronger natural gas prices.\\nIn the United States, the Henry Hub, Louisiana spot price for natural gas, a\\ncommon benchmark for natural gas prices, averaged $2.21 per thousand cubic\\nfeet (MCF) in 1993, an increase of $.41 per MCF over 1992. Strong refined\\nproduct prices, which did not decline as rapidly as crude oil prices, also\\nhelped to dampen the effects of lower crude oil prices. However, product\\nprices in the United States fell late in the year and have remained low into\\n1994. If both crude oil and refined product prices continue at their low\\nlevels, the company\\'s earnings and cash flow from ongoing operations may be\\nnegatively affected. Widely fluctuating prices have become characteristic of\\nthe petroleum industry for the past several years.\\n\\nChevron\\'s average realization from U.S. crude oil production declined from\\n$16.50 per barrel in 1992 to $14.58 per barrel in 1993 while average liquids\\nrealizations from international liftings, including equity affiliates,\\ndeclined by $1.84 per barrel to $16.09 per barrel.

These are\\nto:\\n\\n- -  SHIFT EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION EMPHASIS TO INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.\\n   The company believes opportunities to discover and develop major new\\n   reserves in the United States are limited due to regulatory barriers and\\n   drilling prohibitions on many of the most promising areas of development.\\n   In 1993, 68 percent of the exploration and production capital spending,\\n   including affiliates, was allocated to international operations. In 1994,\\n   that number is expected to increase to 75 percent. As recently as 1990,\\n   U.S. exploration and production capital spending was approximately 50\\n   percent of the total. As an important example of this new emphasis, in\\n   April 1993, the company entered into a joint venture agreement with the\\n   Republic of Kazakhstan to develop the massive Tengiz oil field in that\\n   country.\\n\\n                                     - 2 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n- -  GENERATE $1 BILLION IN CASH ANNUALLY FROM U.S. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION\\n   OPERATIONS. Chevron is emphasizing a steady cash flow from a core group of\\n   approximately 400 oil and gas fields concentrated in California, Texas,\\n   the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico. In 1993, net cash flow after\\n   capital and exploratory expenditures for U.S. exploration and production\\n   operations was more than $1.2 billion. Lower operating expenses and an\\n   improved natural gas market helped to mitigate the effects of lower crude\\n   oil prices. If crude oil prices do not rebound, this goal may be difficult\\n   to achieve in 1994.\\n\\n- -  RESHAPE THE U.S. REFINING AND MARKETING COMPANY INTO A TOP COMPETITOR.\\n   Chevron is currently the leading U.S. marketer of refined products and has\\n   the largest refining capacity in the nation. The company is seeking to\\n   strengthen its competitive position by investing in core refineries,\\n   reducing the size of its refining system and concentrating on specific\\n   marketing regions. Major projects are continuing at the company\\'s Richmond\\n   and El Segundo, California refineries in order to produce reformulated\\n   fuels to meet the January 1995 emission requirements of the Clean Air Act\\n   Amendments of 1990 and the 1996 requirements of the California Air\\n   Resources Board. The company expects to complete the sale of its\\n   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Port Arthur, Texas refineries in 1994,\\n   thereby reducing its refining capacity about 25 percent.\\n\\n- -  GROW CALTEX IN ATTRACTIVE MARKETS. Management believes that the demand for\\n   petroleum products will continue to grow in the Asia Pacific region and\\n   Chevron\\'s 50 percent owned Caltex affiliate, a leading competitor in these\\n   areas, has made significant capital investments to expand and upgrade its\\n   refining capacity. Refinery upgrade projects are currently underway in\\n   Singapore and Korea, as well as the construction of a new refinery in\\n   Thailand.\\n\\n- -  EXPLOIT COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS IN CHEMICALS. The petrochemical industry is\\n   highly cyclical. In order to improve its competitive position, the company\\n   is concentrating on areas of the petrochemical business in which it holds\\n   a competitive advantage, such as in its proprietary Aromax (R) process used\\n   to produce high value benzene from low value by-products of the oil\\n   refining process. The first Aromax (R) plant in the U.S., located at the\\n   company\\'s Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery, was completed in 1993. The\\n   company also announced, in January 1994, a cost reduction plan intended to\\n   reduce annual operating expense by approximately $100 million by 1996. An\\n   integral part of the plan is to divest or close non-core assets and\\n   sharpen the company\\'s focus on the remaining core businesses.\\n\\n- -  BE SELECTIVE IN NON-CORE BUSINESSES. In 1993, Chevron continued to dispose\\n   of marginally performing or non-strategic assets, including various oil\\n   and gas properties located in the United States and Indonesia. The company\\n   also divested its ORTHO lawn and garden products business, retail\\n   marketing operations in Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador, certain\\n   undeveloped coal properties in the U.S., and its Vinwood Cellars Winery in\\n   California. Properties currently for sale include the company\\'s 52.5\\n   percent interest in some zinc-lead prospects in Ireland, refineries\\n   located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Port Arthur, Texas, and the\\n   company\\'s headquarters building located in San Francisco, California.\\n\\n- -  FOCUS ON REDUCING COSTS ACROSS ALL ACTIVITIES. Chevron undertook an\\n   extensive cost-cutting and work force reduction program in early 1992.\\n   These efforts, in combination with the company\\'s continuing program to\\n   dispose of non-core or underperforming assets, reduced 1993 operating\\n   costs, adjusted for special items, by approximately 5 percent or 40 cents\\n   a barrel from 1992 levels. When compared to the base year of 1991, ongoing\\n   operating, selling and administrative expenses have dropped by 11 percent,\\n   or 94 cents a barrel. To remain competitive, the company\\'s management has\\n   set a number of new goals, including a new cost-reduction target of an\\n   additional 25 cents a barrel by the end of 1994.\\n\\nIn 1993, the company established a new \"strategic intent:\"\\n\\n- -  BUILD A COMMITTED TEAM TO ACCOMPLISH THE CORPORATE MISSION. The company\\n   believes the success of the other seven strategic intents is dependent on\\n   the commitment and dedication that Chevron employees bring to their jobs.\\n   In a 1992 employee survey and a 1993 update, Chevron measured employee\\n\\n\\n                                     - 3 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n   commitment using a model that assesses employee\\'s willingness to expend\\n   discretionary effort on the job, combined with how strongly they feel the\\n   company deserves that effort.  The surveys highlighted employee concerns\\n   on issues that the company is addressing.  Due, in part, to the results\\n   of the survey, the company has initiated a number of work and family\\n   programs to help employees improve their productivity and commitment,\\n   such as flexible schedules, part-time work, job sharing and various leave\\n   programs.  The company also presented commemorative wristwatches to its\\n   employees and a one time cash bonus equal to 5 percent of their annual\\n   salaries in appreciation for their efforts in meeting the company\\'s five\\n   year goal, established in 1989, to be number one in stockholders\\' return\\n   among five peer U.S. oil companies.  In February 1994, the company took\\n   delivery of a new vessel, the Chevron Employee Pride, named in honor of\\n   its worldwide workforce.\\n\\n     (b) INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION\\n\\nThe company\\'s primary business is its integrated petroleum operations.\\nSecondary operations include chemicals and minerals.  The petroleum\\nactivities of the company are widely distributed geographically, with major\\noperations in the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria,\\nAngola, Papua New Guinea, China, Indonesia and Zaire. The company\\'s Caltex\\naffiliate, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, conducts exploration and\\nproduction operations in Indonesia and refining and marketing activities in\\nthe Eastern Hemisphere, with major operations in Japan, Korea, Australia, the\\nPhilippines, Thailand and South Africa.  Tengizchevroil (TCO), a 50/50 joint\\nventure with a subsidiary of the national oil company of the Republic of\\nKazakhstan conducts production activities in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet\\nrepublic.\\n\\nThe company\\'s and its affiliates\\' chemicals operations are concentrated in\\nthe United States, but include operating facilities in France, Japan and\\nBrazil.

An increase in\\nexploration and production (E&P) expenditures of $120 million was more than\\noffset by lower expenditures in the company\\'s other operations.\\n\\nExploration and production expenditures amounted to 59 percent of the\\ncompany\\'s consolidated expenditures, a 4 percent increase over 1992 levels.\\nThe increase was due solely to increased expenditures in international E&P as\\nU.S. E&P expenditures continued to decline, down 4 percentage points to 34\\npercent of consolidated E&P expenditures in 1993.  This decrease reflects\\nthe continued shift in the company\\'s emphasis from U.S. exploration and\\nproduction activities to international opportunities.  Major international\\nE&P expenditures in 1993 included development of the Alba Field in the U.K.\\nNorth Sea, the North West Shelf Project in Australia, the Hibernia Project\\noffshore Newfoundland, the Duri steamflood project in Indonesia, Areas B and\\nC in Angola and the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan.  Refining, marketing and\\ntransportation outlays in 1993 included expenditures for upgrading U.S.\\nrefineries to produce fuels, such as low aromatics and ultra low sulfur\\ndiesel fuel and reformulated gasoline, to comply with current and future\\nfederal, state and local air quality regulations.\\n\\nIn 1994, the company expects to spend approximately $4.9 billion, including\\nits share of equity affiliates\\' expenditures, an increase of approximately 11\\npercent over 1993 levels.  Equity affiliate spending, primarily Caltex\\nexpenditures in the high growth Pacific Rim areas, account for this increase\\nas consolidated expenditures in 1994 are expected to remain flat at $3.7\\nbillion.  E&P expenditures are expected to total $2.4 billion, of which\\napproximately 75 percent will be for international projects such as the\\ncontinued development of the Hibernia Field, expansion of the North West\\nShelf Project, enhanced recovery projects in Indonesia, the Tengiz project\\nin Kazakhstan, and other development projects in West Africa.  Refining,\\nmarketing and transportation expenditures are estimated at $2.1 billion,\\nwith U.S. expenditures of about $1 billion, including continued upgrades to\\nU.S. refineries to produce reformulated gasoline in order to comply with the\\nClean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and California Air Resources Board\\nregulations.\\n\\nThe actual expenditures for 1994 will depend on various conditions affecting\\nthe company\\'s operations and may differ significantly from the company\\'s\\nforecast.  If low oil prices persist, expenditures, particularly for\\nexploration and production, may be lower than forecast.

The company is seeking to recover\\napproximately $126 million, plus interest, spent on leases off Florida,\\nNorth Carolina and Alaska.\\n\\nAFRICA: In Africa, the company spent $104 million during 1993 on\\nexploratory efforts, excluding the acquisition of unproved properties,\\ncompared with $108 million in 1992.  The company also acquired $9 million of\\nunproved properties in 1993.  In Nigeria, the company drilled six\\nexploratory and appraisal wells in 1993, with all six either having proved\\nreserves assigned or assignment deferred pending further exploration or\\nevaluation work.  The company also acquired 3-D seismic data covering\\nNigerian acreage of 1,410 square kilometers in 1993 and separately entered\\ninto a farm-in arrangement for the exploration of three offshore\\nconcessions.  In Angola, the company is the operator of a 7,000 square\\nkilometer concession off the coast of Angola\\'s Cabinda exclave.  The\\nconcession is divided into Areas A, B, and C, with Area A generating all\\ncurrent production.  One successful exploration well was drilled in Area A\\nduring 1993 resulting in the discovery of the Numbi South East field which\\nwas brought on stream in 1993 by linking it to the existing Numbi Field\\nfacilities.  Two exploratory wells were drilled in Areas B and C and a third\\nwas drilled at the end of the year.  These resulted in the discovery of the\\nM\\'Bili Field in Area C and a non-commercial accumulation in Area B.  The\\nthird well was tested in Area B as a discovery well, N\\'Sangui, in January\\n1994.  Options for the development of M\\'Bili are currently being evaluated.\\nThe current Exploration Period for Areas B and C was to expire at the end\\nof February 1994 with a provision to fulfill all obligations by the end of\\nAugust 1994.  The company has requested an extension of the Exploration\\nPeriod.  Under the existing agreement, two exploratory wells will be drilled\\nin Areas B and C in 1994.  An additional well may be drilled if the\\nextension is granted.  Chevron (operator) and its partners are currently\\nnegotiating a Production Sharing Agreement for the recently awarded\\nDeepwater Block 14, located due west of Areas B and C.  The agreement is\\nexpected to be completed and signed in 1994.  In the Congo, a regional 3-D\\nsurvey was acquired in 1993 covering the southern part of the Marine VII\\nBlock which includes both the Kitina and Kitina South discoveries, as well\\nas several additional exploration prospects.  In Namibia, the company has\\nbeen conducting a detailed seismic evaluation of the offshore Namibia Block\\n2815, where Chevron is the operator.  In 1993, Chevron farmed-out a portion\\nof its interest in the concession, reducing its share from 60 percent to 40\\npercent.\\n                                    - 7 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nOTHER INTERNATIONAL INCLUDING AFFILIATED COMPANIES: Exploration\\nexpenditures, excluding unproved property acquisitions, were $246 million\\nin 1993, a decrease of $4 million from the 1992 amount of $250 million.  In\\naddition, unproved properties of $430 million, primarily related to the\\ncompany\\'s investment in Tengizchevroil (TCO), were acquired in 1993.\\n\\nIn the North Sea, Chevron participated in four wildcat wells in the U.K.\\nsector in 1993.  A discovery was made in the Paleocene Parliament prospect,\\nto the northeast of Alba and Britannia, thereby establishing area\\npotential.  During the U.K.\\'s 14th licensing round, the company was awarded\\noperatorship of four blocks in the coastal waters to the west of Britain.\\n\\nIn Canada, exploration efforts in 1993 continued to be concentrated in the\\nwestern part of the country.  A total of 23 wildcat wells were drilled in\\n1993 which reflected an increase in drilling activity as a share of total\\nexploratory expenditures.\\n\\nIn Indonesia, Chevron and its partners drilled nine exploratory wells in\\n1993, three of which resulted in oil discoveries.\\n\\nIn Australia, Chevron and its partners in West Australia Petroleum Pty.,\\nLtd. (WAPET) participated in the drilling of the North West Shelf\\nexploration well West Dixon-1, which proved unsuccessful.  A preliminary\\ninterpretation of the Gorgon 3-D seismic survey was completed in 1993 and\\nWAPET has approved the exploratory drilling for gas of North Gorgon-2 in\\n1994.  WAPET also acquired a 519,000 acre block north of Gorgon in 1993.  The\\nnew permit, WA-253-P, will be issued to WAPET in early 1994.\\n\\nIn Papua New Guinea, the government has agreed to grant Chevron and its\\npartners an extension of its exploratory license.  The extension\\nsignificantly extends the time remaining for exploration of a large area of\\nthe Papuan Fold and Thrust Belt. Exploration efforts continue to be\\nconcentrated near the Kutubu project facilities and export system.  The Gobe\\n4X well was drilled before year-end at a location approximately 15\\nkilometers northwest of the SE Gobe field, resulting in an additional oil\\nand gas discovery on this 40 kilometer-long anticline.\\n\\nIn China, Chevron was awarded sole interest in Block 33/08 in the East\\nChina Sea in December.  Seismic studies are planned for the second quarter\\n1994 to determine the optimum location for exploratory drilling.  All\\nexploration and drilling activities will be coordinated from Chevron\\'s\\nnewly-opened Shanghai office.  The HZ/32-4-1 exploratory well in the Pearl\\nRiver Mouth Basin of the South China Sea was abandoned as a dry hole in\\n1993.\\n\\nOther areas where exploration activities occurred in 1993 include Bolivia\\nwhere the first exploratory well (Cuevo West) was completed in March 1994\\nas a dry hole, Trinidad and Tobago where the first of four exploratory\\nwells (Rocky Palace #1) was spudded in late 1993, Colombia where evaluation\\nof the Rio Blanco Block in the Llanos foothills continued in 1993 with the\\nacquisition of a seismic program, Yemen where the exploratory well Al Harsh\\n#1 was unsuccessful, and Azerbaijan where Chevron and the State Oil Company\\nof the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) signed an agreement to jointly study oil\\nand gas reserve potential in the southern third of the Caspian Sea.\\n\\n                                   - 8 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n    PETROLEUM - OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the company\\'s and its affiliate\\'s 1993 net\\nproduction of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas.\\n\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  1993 NET PRODUCTION* OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS\\n\\n                                  CRUDE OIL &           NATURAL GAS\\n                              NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS      (THOUSANDS OF\\n                               (BARRELS PER DAY)    CUBIC FEET PER DAY)\\n                               -----------------    -------------------\\n         United States\\n          -California               130,330               139,110\\n          -Gulf of Mexico           127,500             1,134,910\\n          -Texas                     73,420               403,620\\n          -Louisiana                  5,790                30,060\\n          -Wyoming                   10,610               155,120\\n          -Colorado                  16,560                     -\\n          -New Mexico                 8,630                94,720\\n          -Other States              21,380                98,460\\n                                    -------             ---------\\n         Total United States        394,220             2,056,000\\n                                    -------             ---------\\n\\n         Africa                     217,600                     -\\n         Canada                      49,510               217,650\\n         United Kingdom (North Sea)  49,430                27,670\\n         Indonesia                   31,730                 1,050\\n         Australia                   17,780               163,580\\n         Papua New Guinea            31,040                     -\\n         China                        8,200                     -\\n         Other International          7,750                 6,110\\n                                    -------             ---------\\n         Total International        413,040               416,060\\n                                    -------             ---------\\n         Total Consolidated\\n           Companies                807,260             2,472,060\\n                                    -------             ---------\\n         Equity in Affiliates       142,890                53,370\\n                                    -------             ---------\\n         Total Including\\n           Affiliates               950,150             2,525,430\\n                                    =======             =========\\n         * Net production excludes royalties owned by others.\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPRODUCTION LEVELS:\\n\\nIn 1993, net crude oil and natural gas liquids production, including\\naffiliates, increased by about one percent to 950,150 barrels per day from\\n943,940 barrels per day in 1992. Production increases were noted in Papua\\nNew Guinea due to full year production and additional wells being brought\\non stream in 1993 from the Kutubu project, in Kazakhstan due to the startup\\nof a new joint venture partnership in April 1993, and in Indonesia due to\\nproduction increases as the result of application of enhanced recovery\\nmethods in certain fields. These production increases were partially offset\\nby production declines in the United States due to divestments of producing\\nproperties in 1992 and normal field declines.\\n\\nNet production of natural gas, including affiliates, declined 250,920\\nthousand cubic feet per day, or 9 percent, in 1993 from 1992. The decrease\\nwas primarily due to normal field declines and 1992 divestitures of\\nproducing properties in the United States and the Netherlands. The decline\\nwas partially offset by production from the startup of the company\\'s new\\njoint venture in Kazakhstan.\\n\\nIn the United States, natural gas producers have traditionally sold their\\nproduction to pipeline companies, who in turn distribute the product to\\ntheir customers. As a result of FERC Order 636, producers now can sell\\ndirectly to customers and provide many of the services previously provided\\nby the pipeline companies. Chevron has concentrated its natural gas\\nmarketing efforts on the longer term contract market. These customers,\\nwhich include local distribution companies and industrials, require premium\\nbearing services and marketing arrangements that Chevron can fulfill. The\\ncompany\\'s sales to these customers have risen significantly, while sales to\\npipeline companies have correspondingly declined.\\n\\n                                   - 9 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nData on the company\\'s average sales price per unit of oil and gas\\nproduced, as well as the average production cost per unit for 1993, 1992\\nand 1991 are reported in Table III on pages FS-32 to FS-33 of this Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K.

Forty one new wells were drilled and 45 older wells were\\nreworked using reservoir fracturing techniques.  A four year water injection\\nproject, initiated in 1992, to sustain reservoir pressure and further boost\\nproduction continued into its second year with the drilling of 42 injection\\nwells and the conversion of 18 producing wells to injection.  The\\ncombination of reservoir fracturing and water injection is expected to\\nincrease both the production rate and the amount of oil ultimately\\nrecoverable from this resource.\\n\\nProduction in the Point Arguello project, offshore California, averaged\\n74,000 barrels of oil per day in 1993.  Chevron owns approximately 25\\npercent of the project and operates two offshore platforms (Hermosa and\\nHidalgo), the onshore Gaviota oil and gas plant and the interconnecting\\npipelines.  A workover and drilling program, designed to add proved reserves\\nand abate the decline in production rate, commenced in August 1993 on the\\ntwo offshore platforms.  Five workovers and two new wells, improving\\nChevron\\'s lease production by 4,300 barrels of oil per day, were completed\\nin 1993.  Three additional wells are planned to be drilled in 1994.  Chevron\\nand its partners began double-hulled tankering to Los Angeles of some\\n250,000 barrels of oil three to four times per month from the field\\'s\\nprocessing plant at Gaviota in August 1993 under an agreement with the\\nCalifornia Coastal Commission.  Previously, production was limited to\\napproximately 60,000 barrels per day or 70 percent of full capacity of\\n85,000 barrels per day due to limited onshore pipeline capacity.  Fourth\\nquarter production averaged 80,700 barrels per day.  The terms of the permit\\ngranted by the California Coastal Commission allowed tankering to continue\\nuntil January 1, 1996 but required suspension of tankering from February 1,\\n1994 until such time that Chevron and its partners sign an agreement with a\\npipeline developer that the developer could use to finance construction of\\na new line.  In late January 1994, Chevron approached the California Coastal\\nCommission to permit short-term tankering beyond February 1 due to damage\\nto a key crude oil pipeline system to Los Angeles caused by the Northridge\\nearthquake.  The request was not acted upon by January 31 and short-term\\ntankering was subsequently suspended on February 1.  Although production was\\ninitially maintained by routing to alternate markets, the shortage of\\nadequate transportation facilities has subsequently resulted in reduced\\nproduction.  In March 1994, the company announced that an agreement had been\\nreached on building a new 130 mile pipeline in Southern California that\\nwould carry Point Arguello oil production to Los Angeles.  The company\\nanticipates construction on the Pacific Pipeline will commence in early 1995\\nand be operational in early 1996.

In 1993, twenty-five wells were drilled with twenty-three successes,\\nadding net proved reserves of 70 billion cubic feet of gas. Production\\naveraged 135 million cubic feet of gas per day in 1993. The S. Uribe No. 11\\nwell was completed in 1993 with a sustained flow rate of 23 million cubic\\nfeet of gas per day.\\n\\nAFRICA: Developmental expenditures in Africa were $239 million in 1993,\\ncompared to $189 million in 1992. Additions to proved reserves were 105\\nmillion barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids. In Angola, where\\nChevron\\'s equity interest is 39 percent, ten development wells were added\\nin Area A fields in 1993. In order to sustain production, six existing\\nwells in Area A were reworked and three offshore processing platforms in\\nthe Malongo and Takula Fields were revamped and modernized in 1993.\\nProduction from the N\\'Sano Field, discovered in 1992, was tied back to\\nexisting Takula facilities. A new production platform to fully develop\\nN\\'Sano reserves is under construction for installation later this year.\\nAreas B and C continued to be the major focus of development programs in\\n1993. The first phase of development in these areas involves the\\ninstallation of two integrated drilling and production platforms in the\\nKokongo Field. The East Kokongo platform will also be the hub for future\\nphases of development for Areas B and C. A thirty-eight mile pipeline\\nlinking the platforms to onshore terminal facilities was completed in the\\nfourth quarter of 1993. Platform construction will be completed in Brazil\\nand delivered to Angola with oil production scheduled to begin in late\\n1994. The second phase of development is scheduled for the Sanha and N\\'Dola\\nfields and will consist of two production platforms and related pipelines\\nand facilities for which contracts were awarded in 1993. Commencement of\\nwork has been delayed by partner financing issues. Preliminary development\\nplans for the third phase involving development of the Nemba and Lomba\\nfields have been submitted for governmental approval.\\n\\nIn Nigeria, Chevron is operator and has a 40 percent interest in\\nconcessions totalling 2.3 million acres in onshore and offshore regions in\\nthe Niger Delta. Producing facilities for three new fields, Opuekeba, Idama\\nand Inda, were completed and the fields came on stream during the second\\nhalf of 1993. Combined production from these new fields, along with\\nproduction from the Belma and Belma North unitized field development which\\nbegan in October 1993, is expected to add 60,000 barrels per day to the\\ntotal production capacity in 1994. Upgrade construction work on two\\nproduction platforms, Tapa and Delta South, were completed in 1993. This is\\nthe beginning of a multi-year program which will include all existing\\nplatforms in order to extend the useful life of these facilities and also\\nenhance safety and environmental performance. Work on the Escravos Gas\\nProject, Phase I, continued in 1993. This first phase will utilize gas that\\nis currently being flared in the Okan and Mefa fields. The project will\\ninclude offshore gas compression facilities, an onshore Liquified Petroleum\\nGas (LPG) extraction plant, and a floating LPG storage unit anchored\\noffshore. The project will sell gas under a long term contract to the\\nNigerian Gas Company in addition to producing approximately fifteen\\nthousand barrels per day of hydrocarbon liquids for export. The project is\\nscheduled for start-up in 1997. At year-end, discussions were underway on\\nthe assignment of Chevron as the developer of a West African Gas Pipeline\\nwhich would deliver gas to Ghana via Benin and Togo. The company has an\\nadditional subsidiary in Nigeria that holds a 20 percent interest in five\\noffshore oil fields operated by another partner.\\n\\nIn Zaire, where the company has a 50 percent interest in a 390 square mile\\nconcession off the coast, development and exploration activities resumed in\\n1993 as political unrest subsided. Two developmental wells and four well\\nworkovers in the Mibale, Motoba and Libwa fields were completed in 1993.\\n\\nIn the Congo, where Chevron has a 29.3 percent interest, the 1991 Kitina\\ndiscovery in the offshore Marine VII Block was successfully delineated with\\na second appraisal well.

A sixth field, Alba, started\\nproduction in January 1994. At the Ninian Field in the U.K. North Sea,\\nChevron increased its interest by 6.5 percent to 23.6 percent in December\\n1993. Chevron and its partners began processing third party oil and gas in\\n1992 using available processing capacity at the Ninian facilities. The\\nNinian partners receive tariffs for processing and exporting the production\\nfrom three subsea produced satellite fields - Staffa, Lyell and Strathspey.\\nStaffa production was brought on stream in 1992, followed by production\\nfrom Lyell (Chevron owns a 33.3 percent interest) in March 1993 and\\nStrathspey in December 1993. Lyell production peaked at 31,000 barrels per\\nday and has stabilized at a daily average of 19,000 barrels per day.\\nStrathspey production is currently averaging 17,000 barrels per day, with\\nan expected peak of 41,000 barrels per day. In 1993, Chevron and its\\npartners announced a commercial framework for bringing on future satellite\\nfields through Ninian. Direct drilling from Ninian Northern platform into\\nthe first of four potential satellite prospects began in December. At the\\nAlba Field in the North Sea, development of the first phase of that project\\nwas successfully completed with the installation and hook-up of the Alba\\nNorthern platform and the Alba floating storage unit (FSU) in November.\\nInitial production, expected to peak at 70,000 barrels per day later this\\nyear, began in January 1994 after the FSU was fully commissioned. Work also\\nbegan in 1993 on plans for the second phase of Alba which will develop the\\nsouthern area of the reservoir. The Alba Field, in which Chevron has a 33\\npercent interest, is estimated to contain up to 400 million barrels of\\nrecoverable reserves. At the Britannia Field in the North Sea, a 3-D\\nseismic survey was completed in 1992 and analyzed in 1993 as a guide for\\nfield mapping and development drilling. Delineation drilling results and\\ntechnical studies indicate that approximately two and one-half trillion\\ncubic feet of gas, 175 million barrels of condensate and up to 30 million\\nbarrels of crude oil will be recoverable, with Chevron\\'s share equating to\\napproximately 30 percent. Preliminary facility engineering studies are\\nnearing completion and a firm decision on development options and\\ncommercial arrangements is expected in 1994.\\n\\nIn Canada, the company continues to concentrate its development efforts in\\nsix core producing areas in Alberta and one in Manitoba where operating\\nefficiencies and lower operating costs can be realized using existing\\ninfrastructure.\\n\\nChevron increased its ownership in the Hibernia Field, located\\napproximately 200 miles offshore Newfoundland, by 5 percent to about 27\\npercent in January 1993 after one of the four original project partners\\nwithdrew. In 1993, construction on the project continued with the awarding\\nof the supermodule fabrication contracts, the pouring of the base slab for\\nthe Gravity Base Structure, and the completion of supermodule and hook-up\\nengineering. Hibernia investment is projected to be about $200 million in\\n1994, an increase of $54 million over 1993 levels. Initial production is\\nscheduled for 1997. The company\\'s capitalized investment in this project\\nwas $375 million at year-end 1993.\\n\\nIn Indonesia, Chevron\\'s interests in 14 contract areas are managed by its\\n50 percent owned P.T. Caltex Pacific Indonesia and Amoseas Indonesia\\naffiliates. The Duri Steamflood project, begun in 1985 to assist the\\ndifficult production process for the relatively heavy, waxy Duri crude, is\\nbeing completed in 12 stages (Areas 1-12). Development of Area 7 is\\ncurrently underway. More than three billion additional barrels of oil are\\nexpected to be recovered from the Duri Field as a result of steamflooding.\\nTotal production at Duri averaged 247,000 barrels per day in 1993 and is\\nexpected to peak at just over 300,000 barrels per day by the late 1990s. A\\nwaterflood project involving 21 fields in Central Sumatra, including the\\nMinas field, continued in 1993. Water injection at Minas was initiated in\\nDecember 1993 as part of the conversion of the peripheral waterflood to a\\npattern waterflood which is designed to improve oil recovery. Chevron sold\\nits 17.5 percent share in the South Natuna Sea Block B effective January 1,\\n1994. Chevron\\'s net share of production from this block averaged\\napproximately 11,300 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids per day in\\n1993.\\n\\n                                    - 13 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nIn Kazakhstan, the company formed a 50/50 joint venture with\\nTengizmunaigaz, a subsidiary of Kazakhstanmunaigaz - the national oil\\ncompany of the Republic of Kazakhstan, to develop the Tengiz and Korolev\\noil fields on the northeast coast of the Caspian Sea. This joint venture\\naffiliate, Tengizchevroil (TCO), began operations in April 1993, adding net\\nproved reserves to Chevron of 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil and natural\\ngas liquids and 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Current production\\nhas averaged about 30,000 barrels per day, which is approximately 46\\npercent of the rated crude oil production capacity of 65,000 barrels per\\nday. Production is restricted by limited treatment and transportation\\nfacilities currently available to TCO to bring the oil to world markets.\\nTengiz crude oil production is currently exchanged for Russian crude which\\nis then exported from Russia to world markets. Natural gas, natural gas\\nliquids and sulfur are being sold into local markets. Over the next three\\nto five years, plans call for TCO to spend about $1.5 billion on expanding\\nproduction capacity and infrastructure. Current capacity is expected to\\ndouble to 130,000 barrels per day by 1995 and could reach 260,000 barrels\\nper day by the late 1990s. The pace of field development from 130,000 to\\n260,000 barrels per day is predicated on the construction of an export\\npipeline system capable of handling the full production from the fields.\\nNegotiations to agree on terms for a pipeline project, which would be\\nseparate from the TCO joint venture\\'s Tengiz development project, have\\nproved to be very difficult, and it is currently impossible to predict\\nthe eventual outcome or its impact on the joint venture.\\n\\nIn Australia, the Goodwyn Field, being developed as part of the North West\\nShelf Project in which Chevron holds a one-sixth interest, is scheduled to\\nstart production in 1994. Completion of the offshore platform, originally\\nscheduled for 1993, was delayed due to repair work on the piles. Upon\\ncompletion of the repair work, in first quarter 1994, the topside modules\\nwill be installed and commissioned. Production will flow by a 30 inch\\ndiameter pipeline to the nearby North Rankin platform and then by trunkline\\nto shore. The participants in the North West Shelf Project approved, in\\n1993, the development of the Wanaea Field, the Cossack Field, and an LPG\\nextraction and export project. Combined initial production from the two\\noilfields is forecast at 115,000 barrels per day starting in late 1995. The\\nliquids-rich gas from Wanaea will be combined with gas from the North\\nRankin and Goodwyn fields and processed at the onshore gas plant at\\nKarratha, which is being modified to allow the export sale of LPG. Two new\\nLPG storage tanks and a second product loading jetty are currently under\\nconstruction to handle the extra production. Following start-up in early\\n1996, LPG exports are expected to average 25,000 barrels per day. Drilling\\nand construction for the Roller/Skate oilfield development progressed\\naccording to schedule in 1993. Production is scheduled to commence in 1994\\nat a peak rate of 32,000 barrels per day. Associated gas from the\\nRoller/Skate and Saladin fields will be piped to shore and either sold in\\nthe Perth market or stored in the Dongara field for future sales. The\\nRoller/Skate development, in which Chevron holds about a 26 percent\\ninterest, is a project of the West Australian Petroleum Pty., Ltd.\\n\\nIn Papua New Guinea, Chevron (19 percent interest) and its partners are\\nreviewing the feasibility of developing the SE Gobe Field with possible\\nproduction commencing in 1994.\\n\\nIn China, projects to develop the HZ/32-2 and HZ/32-3 Fields in the South\\nChina Sea were initiated in 1993 with the awarding of the major contract.\\nThe plan includes two platforms, 12 additional wells and a tie-in to the\\nexisting production facility at the HZ/21-1 Field. Initial production,\\nexpected to peak at 45,000 barrels per day, is scheduled for 1995. Chevron\\nholds a 16 percent interest in the venture.\\n\\nOther development projects included the completion of the expanded\\ndevelopment of the Chichimene Field in the Llanos Basin area of Colombia.\\nThe project included development drilling, production facilities and a 35\\nkilometer pipeline.

Chevron\\'s capacity utilization of\\nits domestic cracking and coking facilities, which are the primary\\nfacilities used to convert heavier products to gasoline and other light\\nproducts, averaged 88 percent in 1993, unchanged from 1992.\\n\\nDuring 1993, the company completed the first facility to use Chevron\\'s\\npatented Aromax (R) technology at the Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery. This\\nprocess produces high value benzene from lower valued refining feed stock\\nand will facilitate the company\\'s ability to comply with the requirement to\\nreduce the benzene content in motor gasoline mandated by the Clean Air Act\\nAmendments of 1990. At the El Paso, Texas refinery, the company entered\\ninto an operating agreement with a neighboring refinery which allowed\\nChevron, as operator, to combine the most efficient units from each\\nrefinery in order to lower costs and increase yields. The company also\\ncompleted a $40 million facility at the Salt Lake City, Utah refinery which\\nwill allow the company to economically manufacture ultra low sulfur diesel\\nfuel, one of the few such facilities in that area.\\n\\nIn August 1993, the company installed its proprietary Isodewaxing (R)\\ntechnology at the Richmond lube oil refining plant. This process, which\\nuses a new catalyst developed by the company, boosted lube oil production\\nby 1,500 barrels per day.\\n\\nThe U.S. downstream industry is going through massive recapitalization in\\norder to meet stringent new environmental regulations. This led to the 1993\\nannouncement of a major restructuring of the company\\'s downstream\\noperations. An integral part of this plan is to divest refineries in\\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania and Port Arthur, Texas since these refineries no\\nlonger fit in Chevron\\'s long term plans to have a more strategically\\nfocused U.S. refining operation and will reduce the capital expenditures\\nthat would have been required under the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air\\nAct. In 1993, the company established an $837 million pre-tax provision for\\nthe divestment of these two refineries. This charge was composed primarily\\nof a write-down of the refineries\\' facilities and related inventories to\\ntheir estimated realizable values. Also included in the charges were\\nprovisions for environmental site assessments and employee severance. The\\ncompany has taken into account probable environmental cleanup obligations\\nin estimating the realizable value of the refineries. Responsibility for\\nthese obligations will be negotiated with potential buyers. While\\nnegotiations for the refinery sales are ongoing, it is expected that the\\nreserve will be sufficient to complete the restructuring. In late February\\n1994, the company signed a letter of intent with Sun Company, Inc. for the\\nsale of the Philadelphia refinery.  In late March 1994, the company\\nannounced it has entered into exclusive negotiations with Clark Refining &\\nMarketing, Inc. regarding the sale of its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery. \\n\\nThe company will invest nearly $1 billion in its Richmond and El Segundo,\\nCalifornia refineries over the next three years to produce reformulated\\ngasoline. In addition, a $300 million investment to upgrade key processing\\nunits to improve yields of high value light products is underway at the\\nRichmond refinery.\\n\\nAt the company\\'s Milford Haven, Wales refinery, a new isomerization unit\\nwas brought on stream in 1993. This $54 million unit will enable the\\nrefinery to produce a higher octane blend stock in response to increased\\ndemand for lead-free gasoline and anticipated benzene reduction in European\\ngasoline.\\n\\n                                     - 17 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nIn March 1994, the company announced that it will license technology and\\nprovide engineering design for a major upgrade to the Kirishi Refinery,\\noperated by Kirishinefteexport, in Russia. The key refining process unit\\ncovered by the agreement is a new hydrocracker, scheduled for startup in\\nmid-1999, which will use Chevron\\'s Isocracking technology to maximize\\nproduction of middistillates such as diesel fuel and jet fuel. The company\\nwill also provide technology to remove ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from\\nwater used in the refining process, yielding clean water for reuse.\\n\\nCaltex and its partners completed front-end engineering design of a\\ngrassroots, 130,000 barrels per day refinery in Thailand. The engineering,\\nprocurement and construction contract was awarded in October and the\\nproject is on target for completion in 1996. Work continued on the\\nexpansion/upgrade project at the Singapore export refinery. Completion of\\nthe project, scheduled for mid-1995, will increase refining capacity by\\n60,000 barrels per day, increase yield of light products by 33,000 barrels\\nper day, and enable the refinery to produce oxygenated unleaded gasoline\\nand low sulfur diesel fuel. A Japanese affiliate of Caltex placed a new\\nresiduum desulfurizer into service at the Negishi, Japan refinery. This\\nunit, along with the cracker unit installed last year, will allow the\\nrefinery to increase yields of higher-value products and reduce dependence\\non low sulfur crudes.\\n\\n    PETROLEUM - REFINED PRODUCTS MARKETING\\n\\nPRODUCT SALES: The company and its affiliates, primarily Caltex Petroleum\\nCorporation, sell petroleum products throughout much of the world.

If the demonstration unit using this new technology, to be\\nconstructed and operated at Chevron\\'s Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery,\\nproves successful, the company plans to integrate the technology at\\nPascagoula and expand its paraxylene activities worldwide.\\n \\n    COAL AND OTHER MINERALS\\n\\nCOAL: The company\\'s wholly-owned coal mining and marketing subsidiary, The\\nPittsburg and Midway Coal Mining Co. (P&M), owned and operated four surface\\nand three underground mines at year-end 1993. Three of the mines are\\nlocated in New Mexico and one each in Alabama, Wyoming, Kentucky and\\nColorado. All of the mines produce steam coal used primarily for electric\\npower generation. P&M\\'s strategy is to focus on regional markets in the\\nUnited States, capitalizing on major utility growth markets in the West and\\nSoutheast. Approximately 88 percent of P&M\\'s coal sales are made to\\nelectric utilities. Sales of coal from P&M\\'s wholly-owned mines and from\\nits 50 percent interest in Black Beauty Coal Company were 20.8 million tons\\nin 1993, an increase of 26 percent over 1992. About 57 percent of these\\nsales came from two mines, the McKinley Mine in New Mexico and the Kemmerer\\nMine in Wyoming. The average selling price for coal from mines owned and\\noperated by P&M was $24.62 per ton in 1993, contributing $426 million to\\nChevron\\'s consolidated sales and other operating revenues. At year-end\\n1993, P&M controlled approximately 560 million tons of developed and\\nundeveloped coal reserves.\\n\\nDemand growth for coal in the U.S. remains largely dependent on the demand\\nfor electric power, which in turn depends on regional and national economic\\nconditions and on competition from other fuel sources. Although coal-fired\\ngeneration of electricity grew during 1993, competition among coal\\nproducers kept downward pressure on regional coal prices during much of the\\nyear. However, in the East, a prolonged strike by United Mine Workers of\\nAmerica restricted coal production, tightening coal supplies and driving up\\nspot market prices in the latter half of the year. P&M sells about 88\\npercent of its coal production under multi-year supply agreements, so it is\\nnot particularly exposed to short-term fluctuations in market prices.\\n\\nP&M controls a significant inventory of low-sulfur coal reserves, and the\\ncompany expects demand for this type of coal to grow as utilities start to\\nimplement programs to comply with the air quality emission standards of the\\nClean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In addition, P&M anticipates that the\\nEnergy Policy Act of 1992 will increase competition in the electric power\\nmarket and will provide new market opportunities for low-cost coal\\nproducers.\\n\\nOTHER MINERALS: P&M manages the company\\'s investments in non-coal minerals.\\nThe company expressed its long-term intention to exit the non-coal minerals\\nbusiness, and most such assets have been sold in recent years. The principal\\nassets remaining are a 50 percent interest in the Stillwater Mining Company,\\na Montana platinum-palladium mining operation, and a 52.5 percent interest in\\nsome zinc-lead prospects in Ireland. The company\\'s share of sales and other\\nrevenues from non-coal operations was approximately $21 million in 1993. The\\nsale of the company\\'s 52.5 percent holding in the Irish zinc-lead prospects\\nhas been delayed due to legal challenges. The company expects these challenges\\nto be resolved and the sale completed during 1994.\\n\\n    REAL ESTATE\\n\\nThe company\\'s real estate activities are carried out primarily through its\\nwholly owned subsidiaries, Chevron Land and Development Company and Huntington\\nBeach Company (collectively, Chevron Land).\\n\\n                                    - 22 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nTheir activities have concentrated on converting Chevron\\'s surplus fee\\nproduction properties in California into residential and commercial real\\nestate. After making major infrastructure improvements, the properties are\\nsold to third parties or jointly developed.  At the end of 1993, Chevron\\nLand managed over 26,000 acres of real estate in California.\\n\\nChevron Land participates in residential developments through partnerships\\nwith home builders.  During 1993, the company sold approximately 160 homes\\nin California.  Although this represents a 78 percent increase from the 90\\nhomes sold in 1992, the California housing market continues to be weak as\\nCalifornia lags the rest of the nation in realizing significant renewed\\neconomic growth. The company anticipates that the California real estate\\nmarket will not begin to recover until late 1994 at the earliest and is\\ncurrently positioning itself to take advantage of the recovery when it\\noccurs by developing properties at a pace that meets market demand while\\npreserving current real estate development entitlements. Ten residential\\nhousing projects were actively being developed at year-end, eight through\\njoint venture partnerships.\\n\\nAlthough Chevron\\'s current development emphasis is on the residential\\nsector, the Company also participates in commercial real estate investment\\nand development activities.  The Montebello Town Square in Southern\\nCalifornia, a 250,000 square foot community shopping center situated on 20\\nacres of a former oil field, was sold by the company in 1993. The company\\nalso leases approximately 70,000 acres of irrigated farmland and 160,000\\nacres of rangeland to local growers and ranchers in California\\'s San\\nJoaquin Valley.  In 1993, Chevron Land restructured its organization by\\nreducing its workforce 20 percent and closing or consolidating 5 of its\\noffices. Currently, Chevron Land\\'s activities are predominately handled by\\nthe company\\'s offices in Newport Beach and San Francisco, California.\\n\\n    RESEARCH AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\\n\\nRESEARCH: The company\\'s principal research laboratories are at Richmond\\nand La Habra, California.  The Richmond facility engages in research on new\\nand improved refinery processes, develops petroleum and chemical products,\\nand provides technical services for the company and its customers.  The La\\nHabra facility conducts research and provides technical support in geology,\\ngeophysics and other exploration science, as well as oil production methods\\nsuch as hydraulics, assisted recovery programs and drilling, including\\noffshore drilling.  Employees in subsidiaries engaged primarily in research\\nactivities at year-end 1993 numbered approximately 2,400.\\n\\nIn January 1994, the company signed an agreement with China National\\nPetroleum Corporation to provide enhanced oil recovery technology for\\ntesting in Daqing, China\\'s largest oil field.  The technology, called\\n\"microbial profile modification,\" consists of pumping bacterial spores and\\nnutrients into a reservoir to plug off highly permeable zones in order to\\nimprove the sweep efficiency of a waterflood.  The agreement calls for 15\\nmonths of testing in Chevron Petroleum Technology Company\\'s labs in La\\nHabra, California, followed by a two year pilot program in Daqing.\\n\\nChevron\\'s research and development expenses were $206, $229, and $250\\nmillion for the years 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.\\n\\nThe company owns, controls, or is licensed under numerous patents, but its\\nbusiness is not dependent upon patents.  Licenses under the company\\'s\\npatents are generally made available to others in the petroleum and\\nchemical industries.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: One of Chevron\\'s ongoing corporate strategies is\\nto give high priority to environmental, public and governmental concerns.\\nChevron\\'s revised corporate policy on Health, Environment and Safety was\\napproved by the Stockholders in 1991.  In 1992, a comprehensive series of\\n101 management practices was approved by senior management to strengthen\\nthe implementation of the policy. The program is called \"Protecting People\\nand the Environment\" and is modeled after the Chemical Manufacturers\\nAssociations\\' program called \"Responsible Care.\"  It is also similar to the\\nAmerican Petroleum Institute\\'s program called \"Strategies for Today\\'s\\nEnvironmental Partnership.\"  The program also encompasses previous company\\nprograms to control pollution such as the SMART (Save Money and Reduce\\nToxics) program which focuses on routine, process related, hazardous waste.\\n\\n                                   - 23 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nThe company\\'s oil and gas exploration activities, along with many other\\npetroleum companies, have been hampered by drilling moratoria, imposed\\nbecause of environmental concerns, in areas where the company has leasehold\\ninterests, particularly Alaska, offshore Florida and offshore California.\\nDifficulties and delays in obtaining necessary permits because of\\nenvironmental concerns, such as those experienced by Chevron and its\\npartners in the Point Arguello Field offshore California, can delay or\\nrestrict oil and gas development projects.  While events such as these can\\nimpact current and future earnings, either directly or through lost\\nopportunities, the company does not believe they will have a material\\neffect on the company\\'s consolidated financial position, its liquidity, or\\nits competitive position relative to other domestic or international\\npetroleum concerns.  The situation has, however, been a factor, among\\nothers, in the shift of the company\\'s exploration efforts to areas outside\\nof the United States.\\n\\nThe company will spend an estimated $1.1 billion in capital expenditures\\nover the next 5 years on its refining facilities in order to comply with\\nfederal and state clean air regulations and to provide consumers with fuels\\nthat reduce air pollution and air toxicity.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of\\n1990 (CAAA) requires the production of reformulated gasoline (RFG).\\nBeginning in January 1995, only RFG may be sold in the nine worst ozone\\nareas in the United States.  In addition, the California Air Resources Board\\n(CARB) requires a more stringent reformulated gasoline to be sold statewide\\nbeginning in March 1996.  CAAA required a significant decrease in the sulfur\\ncontent of diesel fuel sold in U.S. markets beginning October 1993.  CARB,\\nin addition to the federal requirements, also mandated a reduction in the\\naromatics content of diesel fuel sold in California.  Chevron introduced low\\naromatics diesel fuel in California and ultra low sulfur diesel fuel in the\\nrest of the nation in October 1993.\\n\\nThe Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) expanded federal authority to\\ndirect responses to oil spills to improve preparedness and response\\ncapabilities and to impose penalties on spillers for restoration costs and\\nloss of use of the resources during restoration.  OPA also requires the\\nphase out of single hull tankers and the phase in of double hull tankers\\nfor trading to U.S. ports.  Many of the coastal states have enacted or are\\npreparing legislation in these same areas.  In 1990, the company began a\\nfleet modernization program, which included seven double hull tankers for\\ndelivery during the 1992-1994 period.  Six of these tankers have been\\ndelivered through the first week of March 1994.  The company has been\\nactively involved in the Marine Preservation Association, a non-profit\\norganization that funds the Marine Spill Recovery Corporation (MSRC).  MSRC\\nowns the largest stockpile of oil spill response equipment in the nation\\nand operates five strategically located U.S. coastal regional centers.\\n\\nThe company expects the enactment of additional federal and state\\nregulations addressing the issue of waste management and disposal and\\neffluent emission limitations for offshore oil and gas operations.  While\\nthe costs of operating in an environmentally responsible manner and complying\\nwith existing and anticipated environmental legislation and regulations,\\nincluding loss contingencies for prior operations, are expected to be\\nsignificant, the company anticipates that these costs will not have a\\nmaterial impact on its consolidated financial position, its liquidity, or its\\ncompetitive position in the industry.\\n\\nDuring 1993, the company\\'s U.S. capitalized environmental expenditures were\\n$620 million, representing approximately 31 percent of the company\\'s total\\nconsolidated U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures.  The company\\'s U.S.\\ncapitalized environmental expenditures were $430 million and $284 million in\\n1992 and 1991, respectively.  These environmental expenditures include capital\\noutlays to retrofit existing facilities, as well as those associated with new\\nfacilities.  The expenditures are predominantly in the petroleum segment and\\nrelate mostly to air and water quality projects and activities at the\\ncompany\\'s refineries, oil and gas producing facilities and service stations.\\nFor 1994, the company estimates that capital expenditures for environmental\\ncontrol facilities will be approximately $637 million.  The actual\\nexpenditures for 1994 will depend on various conditions affecting the\\ncompany\\'s operations and may differ significantly from the company\\'s forecast.\\nThe company is committed to protecting the environment wherever it operates,\\nincluding strict compliance with all governmental regulations.  The future\\nannual capital costs of fulfilling this commitment are uncertain, but for the\\nnext several years are expected to continue at current levels.\\n\\n                                  - 24 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nUnder provisions of the Superfund law, Chevron has been designated as a\\npotentially responsible party (PRP) for remediation of a portion of 223\\nhazardous waste sites.  Since remediation costs will vary from site to site\\nas well as the company\\'s share of responsibility for each site, the number\\nof sites in which the company has been identified as a PRP should not be\\nused as a relevant measure of total liability.  At year-end 1993, the\\ncompany\\'s environmental remediation reserve related to Superfund sites\\namounted to $56 million.  The largest of these sites, located in California,\\naccounts for approximately 20 percent of the reserve.\\n\\nThe company\\'s 1993 environmental expenditures, remediation provisions and\\nyear-end environmental reserves are discussed on pages FS-3 through FS-4 of\\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\n\\nA. Cities Service Tender Offer Cases.\\n\\nThe complaint by Cities Service Co. (\"Cities Services\") and two individual\\nplaintiffs was originally filed in August 1982 in Oklahoma state court in\\nTulsa.  Prior proceedings have effectively eliminated the two individual\\nplaintiffs as parties.  The defendants were initially Gulf Oil Corporation\\nand GOC Acquisition Corporation.  Subsequent filings have identified Chevron\\nU.S.A. Inc. as the successor in interest to Gulf Oil Corporation.  In the\\noriginal complaint Cities Service pleaded for damages of not less than $2.7\\nbillion together with legal interest for breach of contract and\\nmisrepresentation.  The great bulk of the damages were related to claims on\\nbehalf of shareholders of Cities Service.  All of the claims by Cities\\nService shareholders have now been resolved and will ultimately be\\ndismissed.\\n\\nPlaintiff Cities Service has now made new claims by way of a motion to\\namend the petition, which motion was submitted for ruling on February 28,\\n1994, but has not yet been ruled on by the court.  The amended pleading adds\\nOxy U.S.A. as the successor to plaintiff Cities Service, adds Chevron\\nU.S.A. Inc. (as successor to Gulf Oil Corporation) and adds Chevron\\nCorporation as a new defendant.  In addition to the existing claims for\\nbreach of contract and fraud, the amendments add the following causes of\\naction: for willful and malicious breach of contract, negligent\\nmisrepresentation, interference with prospective economic advantage in\\nconnection with the 1989 proposed Oxy-Cities DOE settlement, and adds the\\nclaimed DOE liability as additional contract damages and as additional\\nfraud damages.  The proposed amendment also adds a claim for punitive\\ndamages based upon the alleged fraud, negligent misrepresentation, willful\\nbreach and interference claims.  The new claim requests not less than $100\\nmillion on each of the several claims, together with pre-judgment interest\\nand punitive damages.  It also requests $12 million plus prejudgment\\ninterest for Cities\\' costs in defending against DOE proceedings since 1989,\\nand an order entitling Cities Services to recover such \"restitutionary\\nobligation\" amounts ultimately paid by Oxy U.S.A. to the DOE in excess of\\nits proposed 1989 DOE settlement, and punitive damages.\\n\\n                                   - 25 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nB. In re Gulf Pension Litigation.\\n\\nIn two lawsuits, which were commenced on December 2, 1986 and April 24,\\n1987 and consolidated on July 17, 1987 in the U.S. District Court for the\\nSouthern District of Texas as In re Gulf Pension Litigation, former\\nemployees of Gulf Oil Corporation who were participants in the Gulf Pension\\nPlan contend that a partial termination of the Gulf Pension Plan has\\noccurred and they are entitled to immediate vesting and distribution of\\nplan benefits and to distribution of alleged excess plan assets, which it\\nis alleged have been unlawfully seized by Gulf or Chevron.  The action is\\nbrought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and\\ncommon law, and is primarily an action for damages.  Defendants have filed\\nan answer denying plaintiffs\\' allegations.  On August 21, 1987, the Court\\ncertified a class on these issues consisting of \"all former members of the\\nGulf Pension Plan and the spouses or the beneficiaries of such members.\" On\\nJanuary 4, 1990, the Court certified a subclass of plaintiffs who also\\ncontend that Chevron unlawfully denied them benefits due upon their alleged\\ninvoluntary termination.  A partial settlement agreement was reached during\\ntrial on November 19, 1990 and approved by the court at a January 25, 1991\\nhearing.\\n\\nOn April 10, 1991, the Court issued its opinion on the remaining issues in\\nthe case.  The Court ruled that partial terminations of the Gulf Pension\\nPlan occurred, and ordered all participants in the plan as of July 1, 1986\\nto be vested in their benefits under the plan.  The Court also ruled that\\nparticipants in the Gulf Contributory Retirement Plan (\"CRP\") and the\\nSupplemental Annuity Plan of Mene Grande Oil Company (\"SAP\") were entitled\\nto the surplus assets of those plans.  However, the Court ruled that\\nChevron, otherwise, has the right to retain surplus funds remaining in the\\nGulf Pension Plan after all obligations to the Plan Participants have been\\nsatisfied.  Accordingly, the Court found no impropriety in the merger of the\\nGulf Pension Plan into the Chevron Retirement Plan or the use of plan\\nassets to fund a special early retirement program and pension supplement.\\nHowever, the Court did rule that Gulf and Chevron had incorrectly paid\\ncertain investment management fees out of plan assets and had incorrectly\\nreceived a benefit from the use of pension plan assets in the negotiation\\nof a divestiture sale agreement.\\n\\nOn October 15, 1991, the court approved the terms of a second partial\\nsettlement agreement.  As a part of the second partial settlement, the\\nparties agreed not to appeal the partial termination issues except as\\nrelevant to plaintiff\\'s claim that they are entitled to surplus Gulf\\nPension Plan assets that are not attributable to CRP/SAP.  The second\\npartial settlement does not affect the court\\'s ruling that the plaintiffs\\nare not entitled to approximately $620 million in surplus funds in the Gulf\\nPension Plan.  Plaintiffs have appealed this part of the case to the Fifth\\nCircuit Court of Appeals.  Chevron has appealed the ruling that it\\nincorrectly paid management fees out of the plan\\'s assets and that it\\nreceived a benefit from the use of pension funds.  On April 29, 1993 Chevron\\nreached a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service regarding these\\nissues, which included a payment to the Chevron Retirement Plan and a\\npayment of excise taxes.  Subsequently, Chevron\\'s appeal was dismissed by\\nthe court, although the underlying judgement was not vacated.\\n\\nC. Clean Water Act Violations.\\n\\nOn September 23, 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\\ninstituted an administrative proceeding seeking civil penalties in excess\\nof $100,000 from the company for its self-reported violations of the Clean\\nWater Act since July 1986 at production facilities located on the Outer\\nContinental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico.  The company has agreed with the\\nEPA to settle this matter for $121,000.\\n\\nD. Premanufacture Notifications for Detergent Additives.\\n\\nOn September 30, 1993, the EPA instituted an administrative proceeding\\nseeking civil penalties of about $17 million from the company for alleged\\nviolations of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  The EPA contends\\nthat the company was required to file Premanufacture Notifications (PMNs)\\nwith regard to six chemical substances manufactured or imported since 1990.\\nThe company believes that no PMNs were required because the chemicals were\\nwithin the scope of existing TSCA inventory listings.  Nevertheless, the\\ncompany reported the situation to the EPA when it was advised by a third\\nparty that the EPA may, without public notice, have revised its\\ninterpretation of TSCA regulations to require PMNs to be filed in such\\ncircumstances.  Thereafter, under protest, the company suspended the\\nproduction and importation of the\\n\\n                                   - 26 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nchemicals and filed PMNs for them, continuing the suspension for the\\n90-day period contemplated by TSCA.  The detergents in question are very\\nsimilar to common detergents and intermediates used in their production,\\nand the EPA does not appear to claim that failure to file a PMN resulted in\\nany health or safety risk.  The EPA permitted the company to dispose of its\\ncurrent stocks of the chemicals during the period that the company\\nsuspended their production and importation.\\n\\nE. El Segundo Refinery Reformulated Gasoline Project.\\n\\nOn September 22, 1993, the EPA instituted an administrative proceeding\\ncontending that the company had not received a permit required under the\\nClean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) for field activities at the El\\nSegundo refinery relating to the production of reformulated gasolines,\\nwhich will be federally mandated by 1995 under other provisions of the\\nCAAA.  All company activities had been conducted in accordance with\\nauthorization by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD),\\nthe primary enforcing agency of the rule that the EPA contends the company\\nviolated.  EPA efforts to cause the company to cease all construction\\nactivities were stayed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and SCAQMD\\nhas since issued the company a formal permit to construct.  However, the EPA\\nmay continue to seek civil penalties from the company for activities\\nconducted prior to the issuance of the permit.\\n\\nOther previously reported legal proceedings have been settled or the\\nissues resolved so as not to merit further reporting.\\n\\n                                     - 27 -\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nITEM 4.

However, special items in all\\nyears and the cumulative effect of adopting two new accounting standards\\nin 1992 affected the comparability of the company\\'s reported results.\\nSpecial items, after related tax effects, decreased 1993 earnings $883\\nmillion, increased 1992 earnings $651 million and decreased 1991 earnings\\n$66 million. Also, the cumulative effect of adopting the two new accounting\\nstandards reduced 1992 earnings $641 million. Excluding the effects of\\nspecial items and the accounting changes, 1993 earnings of $2.148 billion\\nwere up 38 percent from $1.559 billion in 1992 and increased 58 percent\\nfrom $1.359 billion in 1991.\\n\\nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK.  Crude oil prices began trending downward\\nat midyear.  The decline accelerated during the last two months of 1993,\\nwith prices reaching their lowest level in over five years by year-end.\\nDuring the year, Chevron\\'s posted price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI),\\na benchmark crude, declined $5.50 per barrel to $13.25 at year-end 1993.\\nWorldwide demand for crude oil has been dampened by the weak global economy;\\nproduction in the non-OPEC countries has increased, particularly in the\\nNorth Sea; and the OPEC producers have not adjusted their production levels\\naccordingly. On the other hand, natural gas prices in the United States\\nremained strong in 1993, with the company\\'s average realization of $1.99\\nper thousand cubic feet nearly 30 cents higher than in 1992. For most of\\n1993, refined product prices did not decline as quickly as crude oil prices,\\nresulting in strong worldwide sales margins. However, late in the year, the\\ndecline accelerated in the United States and product prices have remained\\nat lower levels into early 1994.\\n\\nEconomic indicators show evidence that the U.S. economy is improving;\\nhowever, recessionary conditions continue in other major countries. Bitter\\ncold weather in the U.S. Midwest and East strengthened crude oil prices\\nsomewhat in early 1994 but by February 25 Chevron\\'s posted price for WTI\\nhad fallen back to the year-end 1993 level. Natural gas prices remained\\nfirm, with average U.S. natural gas realizations in January 1994 of $2.03\\nper thousand cubic feet.\\n\\nIf both crude oil and refined product prices continue at their low levels,\\nthe company\\'s earnings from ongoing operations may be negatively affected.\\nWidely fluctuating prices have become characteristic of the petroleum\\nindustry for the past several years. The company has made significant\\nprogress in streamlining its businesses and reducing costs in recent years\\nand believes it has improved its ability to operate more competitively and\\nprofitably.\\n\\nYEAR-END 1993 MARKED THE END OF A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD, FOR WHICH AGGRESSIVE\\nMANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES HAD BEEN SET IN EARLY 1989.  The company\\ndeclared its mission was to provide superior financial results for the\\ncompany\\'s stockholders. The objective was set to have a higher total\\nstockholder return - stock appreciation plus reinvested dividends - than\\nfive other major U.S. oil companies against which the company measures\\nits performance. To achieve this, the company embarked upon an aggressive\\nprogram to restructure its businesses, improve management decision making\\nand accountability, shed marginal and non-core assets, reduce operating\\ncosts, improve work processes, and through selective investments, position\\nthe company for long-term growth. Over the 1989-1993 period, Chevron\\'s\\ntotal annual stockholder return averaged 18.9 percent, the best among its\\npeer group. The company disposed of marginal and non-core assets, generating\\nalmost $4 billion in cash proceeds during this period, and reduced its\\nannual cost structure by about $1 billion in 1993 from\\n\\n\\n                                    FS-1\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n1991 levels.  Using the company\\'s method of measuring cost performance,\\ncosts were reduced from $7.45 per barrel in 1991 to $6.51 in 1993, a\\nreduction of $.94 per barrel, or nearly 13 percent.\\n\\nIN EARLY 1994, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NEW FIVE-YEAR GOAL OF MAINTAINING\\nITS POSITION AS THE NO. 1 MAJOR U.S. OIL COMPANY IN TOTAL STOCKHOLDER\\nRETURN.  Key elements include targeting a further $.25 per barrel reduction\\nin operating and administrative costs by the end of 1994; attaining a 12\\npercent return on capital employed, after adjusting for special items; and\\npursuing growth opportunities - particularly in international exploration\\nand production and, through its Caltex affiliate, in refining and marketing\\nactivities in the fast growing Asia-Pacific region.\\n\\nUNITED STATES REFINING AND MARKETING DEVELOPMENTS.  The company announced a\\nmajor restructuring of its U.S. refining and marketing business in May 1993.\\nThe company\\'s refineries at Port Arthur, Texas, and Philadelphia,\\nPennsylvania, will be sold and investments in retail marketing activities in\\nthe East will be concentrated in the Gulf Coast states.  As a result, the\\ncompany\\'s U.S. refining capacity will decrease about 350,000 barrels per\\nday, or 25 percent, and U.S. refined product sales volumes may decline about\\n250,000 barrels per day, or about 17 percent from 1993 volumes.  However,\\nthe new refining organization, while smaller, is expected to be more\\nefficient, with improved cash flow and return on capital employed.  It will\\nalso eliminate the large capital investments that would have been required\\nfor these facilities under the Clean Air Act and other environmental\\nregulations.  A provision of $543 million was recorded for the financial\\neffects of the restructuring.  In late February 1994, the company signed a\\nletter of intent to sell the Philadelphia refinery to Sun Company, Inc.\\nWhile negotiations for the refinery sales are ongoing, it is expected that\\nthe reserve will be sufficient to complete the restructuring.\\n\\nUNITED STATES EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION DEVELOPMENTS.  The interim\\ntankering permit issued by the California Coastal Commission required the\\nPoint Arguello partners to have signed an agreement by February 1, 1994\\nthat would allow a pipeline developer to secure financing for construction\\nof a pipeline to the Los Angeles area.  Because of ongoing negotiations, the\\ndeadline was not met and tankering was suspended.  With tankering, the\\nproject had been producing over 80,000 barrels per day.  The partners have\\nthus far maintained production volumes by routing the oil to alternate\\nmarkets, pending resolution of the negotiations and resumption of\\ntankering.  Chevron is operator and owns approximately 25 percent of the\\nproject.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION DEVELOPMENTS.  Tengizchevroil\\n(TCO), the company\\'s joint venture with the Republic of Kazakhstan to\\ndevelop the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields on the northeastern coast of\\nthe Caspian Sea, began operations in April 1993.  The oil is being exported\\ninto world markets under a transportation/exchange agreement with Russia,\\nwhereby TCO receives and exports crude oil from Russia in exchange for\\nproviding Russia with comparable amounts of Tengiz crude.  Natural gas,\\nnatural gas liquids and sulfur are being sold into local markets.  Upon\\nformation of the joint venture, Chevron\\'s net proved reserves of crude\\noil and natural gas liquids increased 1.1 billion barrels and net proved\\nreserves of natural gas increased 1.5 trillion cubic feet, representing the\\ncompany\\'s share of TCO\\'s current net proved reserves.\\n\\nCrude oil production capacity is 65,000 barrels per day; however, because\\nof pipeline transportation constraints, production has averaged\\napproximately 30,000 barrels per day since April.  At year-end 1993, the\\ncompany\\'s cash investment in TCO was about $220 million.  In addition,\\nthe company has accrued future field development obligations and amounts\\npayable after completion and demonstrated operability of an export\\npipeline system.  Over the next three to five years, plans call for TCO\\nto spend about $1.5 billion to reach a production capacity of 260,000\\nbarrels per day by the late 1990s.  Current capacity is expected to double\\nto 130,000 barrels per day by 1995.  The pace of field development from\\n130,000 to 260,000 barrels per day is dependent on the ability to export\\nthe full production capacity.  This will ultimately require the construction\\nof an export pipeline system, which is separate from the TCO joint\\nventure\\'s Tengiz development project.  Negotiations to agree on terms for a\\npipeline project have proved to be very difficult, and it is currently\\nimpossible to predict the eventual outcome or its impact on the joint\\nventure.\\n\\nIn January 1994, production began from the Alba oil field in the United\\nKingdom North Sea.  Chevron is operator and owns one-third of this project.\\nProduction should peak at about 70,000 barrels per day later in 1994.\\n\\n\\n                               FS-2\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nChevron has significant oil and gas exploration and production operations\\nin Nigeria and in the Angolan exclave of Cabinda, where its share of net\\nproduction is about 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day from each of these\\ncountries.  Angola has experienced civil unrest following its 1992 elections;\\nseparately, elements seeking independence of Cabinda from Angola have\\nperiodically created civil unrest in the area of the company\\'s operations.\\nAlso, the nullification of the Nigerian elections in 1993 has been followed\\nby a period of political uncertainty.  To date, none of these events has had\\na significant impact on the company\\'s operations, but the company is closely\\nmonitoring developments.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the\\ncompany engages are subject to various federal, state and local\\nenvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations.  These regulatory\\nrequirements continue to increase in both number and complexity and govern\\nnot only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also\\nthe products it sells.  Most of the costs of complying with myriad laws and\\nregulations pertaining to its operations and products are embedded in the\\nnormal costs of conducting its business.  Using definitions and guidelines\\nestablished by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimates its\\nworldwide environmental spending in 1993 was nearly $1.5 billion, of which\\n$675 million were capital expenditures.  These amounts do not include\\nnon-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation programs, but\\ninclude spending charged against such reserves.\\n\\nIn addition to the various federal, state and local environmental laws and\\nregulations governing its ongoing operations and products, the company (as\\nwell as other companies engaged in the petroleum or chemicals industries)\\nis required to incur expenses for corrective actions at various facilities\\nand waste disposal sites.  An obligation to take remedial action may be\\nincurred as a result of the enactment of laws, such as the federal\\nSuperfund law, or the issuance of new regulations or as the result of\\naccidental leaks and spills in the ordinary course of business.  In addition,\\nan obligation may arise when a facility is closed or sold.  Most of the\\nexpenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites\\nwhere past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered\\nacceptable under regulations existing at the time performed, but now will\\nrequire investigatory and/or remedial work to ensure adequate protection to\\nthe environment.\\n\\nDuring 1993, the company recorded $215 million of before-tax provisions to\\nprovide for environmental remediation efforts, including Superfund sites.\\nActual expenditures charged against these provisions and other previously\\nestablished reserves amounted to $183 million in 1993.  At year-end 1993,\\nthe company\\'s environmental remediation reserve was $746 million, including\\n$56 million related to Superfund sites.  Receivables of $18 million have been\\nrecorded for expected reimbursements of expenditures for environmental\\ncleanup.\\n\\nUnder provisions of the Superfund law, the Environmental Protection Agency\\n(EPA), as well as certain state agencies, have designated Chevron a\\npotentially responsible party (PRP) for remediation of a portion of 223\\nhazardous waste sites.  At year-end 1993, the company\\'s cumulative share of\\ncosts and settlements for approximately 145 of these sites, for which\\npayments or provisions have been made in 1993 and prior years, was about\\n$89 million, including a provision of $6 million during 1993.  For the\\nremaining sites, investigations are not yet at a stage where the company is\\nable to quantify a probable liability or determine a range of possible\\nexposure.  The Superfund law provides for joint and several liability.  Any\\nfuture actions by the EPA and other regulatory agencies to require Chevron\\nto assume other responsible parties\\' costs at designated hazardous waste\\nsites are not expected to have a material effect on the company\\'s\\nconsolidated financial position or liquidity.\\n\\nProvisions are recorded for work at identified sites where an assessment or\\nremediation plan has been developed and for which costs can reasonably be\\nestimated.  It is likely the company will continue to incur additional\\ncharges for environmental programs relating to past operations.  These future\\ncosts are indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of\\npossible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective\\nactions that may be required, the determination of the company\\'s liability\\nin proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such\\ncosts are recoverable from insurance or other sources.  While the amounts of\\nfuture costs may be material to the company\\'s results of operations in the\\nperiod in which they are recognized, the company does not expect these costs\\nto have a material effect on Chevron\\'s consolidated financial position or\\nliquidity.  Also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such\\nexpenditures have had or will have any significant impact on the company\\'s\\ncompetitive position relative to other domestic or\\n\\n\\n                                    FS-3\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\ninternational petroleum or chemicals concerns.  Although environmental\\ncompliance costs are substantial, the company has no reason to believe\\nthey vary significantly from similar costs incurred by other companies\\nengaged in similar businesses in similar areas.  The company believes that\\nsuch costs ultimately are reflected in the petroleum and chemicals\\nindustries\\' prices for products and services.\\n\\nThe 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act will require significant capital\\nexpenditures for the industry to meet clean-air regulations.  The company\\'s\\ncapital expenditures related to air quality were $434 million in 1993.\\nEstimated 1994 total capital environmental expenditures are $686 million,\\nof which $478 million will be spent to meet federal and state clean-air\\nregulations for its products and facilities.  This is in addition to the\\nongoing costs of complying with other environmental regulations.\\n\\nIn addition to the reserves for environmental remediation discussed above,\\nthe company maintains reserves for dismantlement, abandonment and\\nrestoration of its worldwide oil, gas and mineral properties at the end of\\ntheir productive lives.  Most such costs are environmentally related.\\nProvisions are recognized through depreciation expense as the properties are\\nproduced.  The amount of these reserves at year-end 1993 was about $1.5\\nbillion.\\n\\nFor the company\\'s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries, no\\nprovisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when\\nsuch assets reach the end of their useful lives.\\n\\nOTHER CONTINGENCIES.  At year-end 1993 the company had $222 million of\\nsuspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment.\\nThe wells are suspended pending drilling of additional wells to determine\\nif commercially producible quantities of oil or gas reserves are present.\\nThe ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of\\nthis future activity.\\n\\nThe company is the subject of various lawsuits and claims and other\\ncontingent liabilities.  These are discussed in the notes to the accompanying\\nconsolidated financial statements.  The company believes that the resolution\\nof these matters will not materially affect its financial position or\\nliquidity.\\n\\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  In November 1992, the Financial Accounting\\nStandards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards\\n(SFAS) No. 112, \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits,\"\\nwhich established accounting standards for employers who provide benefits\\nto former or inactive employees after termination but before retirement.  In\\nMay 1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 115, \"Accounting for Certain Investments\\nin Debt and Equity Securities.\"  The company\\'s current accounting practices\\nare substantially in compliance with the new standards.  Accordingly, the\\nadoption of these two standards in the first quarter of 1994 will not have a\\nmaterial effect on the company\\'s consolidated financial statements and will\\nnot affect its liquidity.\\n\\nSPECIAL ITEMS.  Net income is affected by transactions that are unrelated to,\\nor are not representative of, the company\\'s ongoing operations for the\\nperiods presented.

The Ortho lawn and garden\\nproducts business was the major asset sold in 1993, generating a $130\\nmillion gain.  In addition, oil and gas properties in the United States and\\nIndonesia, undeveloped coal properties in the United States and marketing\\nassets in Central America were sold during the year resulting in a net loss\\nof $8 million.  In 1992, assets sold included oil and gas properties in the\\nUnited States, United Kingdom, Canada and Sudan; a U.S. fertilizer business;\\nand a copper interest in Chile.  In addition, the stock of a U.S. oil and\\ngas subsidiary was exchanged with Pennzoil Company for 15,750,000 shares of\\nChevron stock, a transaction valued at $1.1 billion.  The\\n\\n\\n                                  FS-4\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\ncombination of these and other smaller sales resulted in after-tax gains of\\n$757 million.  In 1991, sales of producing properties in the United States,\\nOman and Spain; non-producing properties in the United Kingdom; certain U.S.\\ngeothermal properties; an agricultural chemicals interest, together with the\\ncompany\\'s share of the gain on an asset sale by its Caltex affiliate,\\nresulted in net gains of $149 million.\\n\\nRESTRUCTURINGS AND REORGANIZATIONS charges in 1993 amounted to $554 million,\\nprimarily the second quarter provision to restructure Chevron\\'s U.S.\\nrefining and marketing business.  This charge, totaling $543 million, was\\ncomposed primarily of a write-down of the refineries\\' facilities and related\\ninventories to their estimated realizable values.  Also included in the\\ncharges were provisions for environmental site assessments and employee\\nseverance.  The company has taken into account probable environmental cleanup\\nobligations in estimating the realizable value of the refineries.\\nResponsibility for these obligations will be negotiated with potential\\nbuyers.  In 1992, Chevron recorded a net charge of $40 million associated\\nwith restructuring and work-force reductions - provisions of $105 million\\nfor work-force reductions were offset by $65 million of pension settlement\\ngains in connection with the company\\'s enhanced early retirement program.\\nDuring 1991, charges of $185 million were recorded for the reconfiguration\\nof the Port Arthur refinery and companywide work-force reductions.\\n\\nPRIOR-YEAR TAX ADJUSTMENTS are generally the result of issues in open tax\\nyears being settled with taxing authorities or being re-evaluated by the\\ncompany as a result of new developments. Also, adjustments are required\\nfor the effect on deferred income taxes of changes in statutory tax rates.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PROVISIONS pertain to estimated future costs for\\nenvironmental remediation programs at certain of the company\\'s U.S. service\\nstations, marketing terminals, refineries, chemical plants and other\\nlocations; divested operations in which Chevron has liability for future\\nremediation costs; and sites, commonly referred to as Superfund sites, for\\nwhich the company is a PRP.  In addition to an amount included in the 1993\\nrestructuring charge discussed above, such provisions amounted to $90\\nmillion in 1993, $44 million in 1992 and $160 million in 1991.\\n\\nASSET WRITE-OFFS AND REVALUATIONS in 1993 comprised certain U.S. refinery\\nassets, U.S. and Canadian production assets, and miscellaneous corporate\\nassets.  Asset write-offs in 1992 consisted of a $110 million write-down\\nof the company\\'s Canadian Beaufort Sea properties and a net $23 million\\ncharge related to certain U.S. refining, marketing and chemical fertilizer\\nassets.  Certain U.S. refinery assets of $24 million were written off in\\n1991.\\n\\nLIFO INVENTORY GAINS AND LOSSES result from the reduction of inventories\\nin certain inventory pools valued under the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)\\naccounting method.  LIFO losses decreased 1993 net income $46 million and\\n1992 net income $26 million.  However, drawdowns of LIFO-valued inventories\\nincreased net income in 1991 by $16 million as low-cost inventories, relative\\nto then-current costs, were liquidated.  These amounts include the company\\'s\\nequity share of Caltex LIFO inventory effects.  Chevron\\'s consolidated\\npetroleum inventories were 99 million barrels at year-end 1993, 105 million\\nbarrels at year-end 1992 and 121 million barrels at year-end 1991.\\n\\nOTHER SPECIAL ITEMS in 1993 included net additions of $70 million to\\nreserves for various litigation and regulatory issues and a one-time cash\\nbonus award to employees totaling $60 million, offset by a favorable\\ninventory adjustment of $16 million.  In 1992, insurance recoveries and\\nchemical products licensing agreements of $76 million were partially\\noffset by $11 million of net additions to reserves for various litigation\\nand regulatory issues.  In 1991, additions of $35 million were made to\\nlitigation and regulatory reserves.\\n\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Strong worldwide refined product sales margins and\\nhigher U.S. natural gas prices mitigated the effects of lower crude oil\\nprices in 1993, but the most important contributor to the company\\'s improved\\noperating performance was the large reduction in its operating and\\nadministrative costs.  Also, lower interest and exploration expenses helped\\nearnings.  Chemicals operations continued at depressed levels.\\n\\nSimilar to 1993, the increase in 1992 operating earnings from 1991 levels\\nreflected reduced operating and administrative costs, higher U.S. natural\\ngas prices and improved U.S. refined product sales margins.  These benefits\\nwere partly offset by lower earnings in international refining and marketing\\nand worldwide chemicals operations as weak global economic conditions held\\ndown product prices, shrinking sales margins.\\n\\n\\n                                    FS-5\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nSALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES were $36.2 billion, down from $38.2\\nbillion in 1992 and $38.1 billion in 1991.  Revenues declined from 1992 and\\n1991 levels primarily due to lower crude oil and refined products prices\\npartly offset by higher natural gas prices.\\n\\nThe $.6 billion decline in OTHER INCOME in 1993 was due to lower asset sales\\ngains.\\n\\nOPERATING EXPENSES, adjusted for special items, declined significantly as a\\nresult of the company\\'s extensive cost-reduction programs initiated in early\\n1992.

Coupled with the $512\\nmillion reduction in 1992 from 1991 levels, the two-year reduction in costs\\ntotaled $870 million, an 11 percent decrease from 1991.

dollars\\n\\nNOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Chevron Corporation and its\\nconsolidated subsidiaries (the company) employ accounting policies that are in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\\n\\nSUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES.  The consolidated financial statements\\ninclude the accounts of subsidiary companies more than 50 percent owned.\\nInvestments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a\\nsubstantial ownership interest of approximately 20 to 50 percent, or for which\\nthe company participates in policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity\\nmethod.  Under this accounting, remaining unamortized cost is increased or\\ndecreased by the company\\'s share of earnings or losses after dividends.\\n\\nOIL AND GAS ACCOUNTING.  The successful efforts method of accounting is used\\nfor oil and gas exploration and production activities.\\n\\nSHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.  Short-term investments that are part of the company\\'s\\ncash management portfolio are classified as cash equivalents.  These\\ninvestments are highly liquid and generally have original maturities of\\nthree months or less.  All other short-term investments are classified as\\nmarketable securities.\\n\\nINVENTORIES.  Crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals and other merchandise\\nare stated at cost, using a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method.  In the\\naggregate, these costs are below market.  Materials and supplies inventories\\ngenerally are stated at average cost.\\n\\nPROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  All costs for development wells, related\\nplant and equipment (including carbon dioxide and certain other injected\\nmaterials used in enhanced recovery projects), and mineral interests in oil\\nand gas properties are capitalized.  Costs of exploratory wells are\\ncapitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves.\\nCosts of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized.  All\\nother exploratory wells and costs are expensed.\\n\\nProved oil and gas properties are regularly assessed for possible impairment\\non an aggregate worldwide portfolio basis, applying the informal \"ceiling\\ntest\" of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Under this method, the\\npossibility of an impairment may exist if the aggregate net book carrying\\nvalue of these properties, net of applicable deferred income taxes, exceeds\\nthe aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, after tax, from the properties,\\nas calculated in accordance with accounting rules for supplemental\\ninformation on oil and gas producing activities.  In addition, high-cost,\\nlong-lead-time oil and gas projects are individually assessed prior to\\nproduction start-up by comparing the recorded investment in the project with\\nits fair market or economic value, as appropriate.  Economic values are\\ngenerally based on management\\'s expectations of discounted future after-tax\\ncash flows from the project at the time of assessment.\\n\\nDepreciation and depletion (including provisions for future abandonment\\nand restoration costs) of all capitalized costs of proved oil and gas\\nproducing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the\\nunit-of-production method by individual fields as the proved developed\\nreserves are produced.  Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved\\nmineral interests are determined using the unit-of-production method by\\nindividual fields as the related proved reserves are produced. Periodic\\nvaluation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral\\ninterests are expensed.\\n\\nDepreciation and depletion expenses for coal and other mineral assets are\\ndetermined using the unit-of-production method as the proved reserves are\\nproduced.  The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are\\ndepreciated or amortized over estimated useful lives.  In general, the\\ndeclining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the\\nUnited States; the straight-line method generally is used to depreciate\\ninternational plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased\\nassets.\\n\\nGains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties,\\nplant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation.\\nGains or losses from abnormal retirements or sales are included in income.\\n\\nExpenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals to maintain\\nfacilities in operating condition are expensed.  Major replacements and\\nrenewals are capitalized.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES.  Environmental expenditures that relate to\\ncurrent ongoing operations or to an existing condition caused by past\\noperations are expensed.  Expenditures that create future benefits or\\ncontribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.\\n\\nLiabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when\\nenvironmental assessments and/or cleanups are probable, and the costs can be\\nreasonably estimated.  Other than for assessments, the timing of these\\naccruals coincides with the company\\'s commitment to a formal plan of action,\\nsuch as an approved remediation plan or the sale or disposal of an asset.\\nFor oil and gas and coal producing properties, a provision is made through\\ndepreciation expense for anticipated abandonment and restoration costs at\\nthe end of the property\\'s useful life.\\n\\nFor Superfund sites, the company records a liability for its share of costs\\nwhen it has been named as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) and when an\\nassessment or cleanup plan has been developed.  This liability includes the\\ncompany\\'s own portion of the costs and also the company\\'s portion of amounts\\nfor other PRPs when it is probable that they will not be able to pay their\\nshare of the cleanup obligation.\\n\\nThe company records the gross amount of its liability based on its best\\nestimate of future costs in current dollars and using currently available\\ntechnology and applying current regulations as well as the company\\'s own\\ninternal environmental policies.  Future amounts are not discounted.  Probable\\nrecoveries or reimbursements are recorded as an asset.\\n\\n\\n                                    FS-18\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nNOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued\\n\\nCURRENCY TRANSLATION. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the\\ncompany\\'s consolidated operations as well as for substantially all operations\\nof its equity method companies. For those operations, all gains or losses\\nfrom currency transactions are included in income currently. The cumulative\\ntranslation effects for the few equity affiliates using functional currencies\\nother than the U.S. dollar are included in the currency translation\\nadjustment in stockholders\\' equity.\\n\\nTAXES. Effective 1992, the company accounts for income taxes in accordance\\nwith Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, \"Accounting for\\nIncome Taxes.\" In 1991, the company accounted for income taxes in accordance\\nwith Statement No. 96, \"Accounting for Income Taxes.\" Income taxes are\\naccrued for retained earnings of international subsidiaries and corporate\\njoint ventures intended to be remitted. Income taxes are not accrued for\\nunremitted earnings of international operations that have been, or are\\nintended to be, reinvested indefinitely.\\n\\nRECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN REVENUES AND PURCHASES. To conform to the\\npresentation in 1993, the years 1992 and 1991 in the consolidated income\\nstatement were reclassified to net certain offsetting forward crude oil\\npurchases and sales contracts. This reclassification had no effect on net\\nincome for any period. Sales and other operating revenues, and purchased\\ncrude oil and products, decreased $3,216 for 1992 and $2,002 for 1991, from\\nthe amounts previously reported.\\n\\nNOTE 2: ADOPTION OF STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 106,\\n\"EMPLOYERS\\' ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS\"\\n(SFAS 106) AND NO. 109, \"ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES\" (SFAS 109) Effective\\nJanuary 1, 1992, the company adopted SFAS 106 and SFAS 109, issued by the\\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board. The effects of these statements on\\n1992 net income included a charge of $641, or $1.89 per share, attributable\\nto the cumulative effect of adoption, including the company\\'s share of\\nequity affiliates. This net charge was composed of $833, after related tax\\nbenefits of $423, for the recognition of liabilities for retiree benefits\\n(primarily health and life insurance), partially offset by a credit of $192\\nfor deferred income tax benefits and other changes stipulated by the new\\nincome tax accounting rules.\\n\\nApart from the cumulative effect, adoption of the statements increased\\nearnings for 1992 by $163 after tax, or $.48 per share. Under the new income\\ntax accounting, benefits of $200 were recorded, largely due to the\\nstrengthening of the dollar in 1992, which resulted in lower foreign\\ndeferred tax liabilities. These benefits were partly offset by $37 of\\nadditional after-tax expense for retiree benefits, when compared to the\\nprevious practice of expensing these costs when paid.\\n\\nNOTE 3: SPECIAL ITEMS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Net income is affected\\nby transactions that are unrelated to or are not representative of the\\ncompany\\'s ongoing operations for the periods presented. These transactions,\\ndefined by management and designated \"special items,\" can obscure the\\nunderlying results of operations for a year as well as affect comparability\\nof results between years.\\n\\nListed below are categories of special items and their net increase\\n(decrease) to net income, after related tax effects:\\n\\n                                                       Year Ended December 31\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                   1993       1992       1991\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAsset dispositions, net\\n  Ortho lawn and garden products                  $ 130       $  -       $  -\\n  Oil and gas properties                            (25)       209         44\\n  Stock exchange with Pennzoil Company                -        376          -\\n  Copper interest in Chile                            -        159          -\\n  Other                                              17         13        105\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                    122        757        149\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAsset write-offs and revaluations\\n  Oil and gas properties                            (31)      (110)         -\\n  Refining and marketing assets                     (24)       (31)       (24)\\n  Other                                             (16)         8          -\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                    (71)      (133)       (24)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nPrior-year tax adjustments                         (130)        72        173\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nEnvironmental remediation provisions                (90)       (44)      (160)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRestructurings and reorganizations\\n  Work-force reductions, net                        (11)       (40)      (102)\\n  U.S. Refining and marketing                      (543)         -        (83)\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                   (554)       (40)      (185)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLIFO inventory (losses) gains                       (46)       (26)        16\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOther, net\\n  Litigation and regulatory issues                  (70)       (11)       (35)\\n  One-time employee bonus                           (60)         -          -\\n  Chemicals products license agreements               -         32          -\\n  Other adjustments                                  16         44          -\\n                                                -----------------------------\\n                                                   (114)        65        (35)\\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n Total special items, after tax*                  $(883)      $651       $(66)\\n=============================================================================\\n*Amounts include the company\\'s share of equity affiliates\\' transactions.\\n\\nThe U.S. refining and marketing restructuring charge of $543 was primarily\\ncomposed of a writedown of two refineries and their related inventories to\\nestimated realizable values.

INFORMATION RELATING TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS The\\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes the following non-cash\\ntransactions:\\n\\nIn 1993, the company acquired a 50 percent interest in the Tengizchevroil\\njoint venture (TCO) in the Republic of Kazakhstan through a series of cash\\nand non-cash transactions. The company\\'s interest in TCO is accounted for\\nusing the equity method of accounting and is recorded in \"Investments and\\nadvances\" in the consolidated balance sheet. The cash expended in connection\\nwith the formation of TCO and subsequent advances to TCO have been included\\nin the consolidated statement of cash flows in \"Capital expenditures.\" The\\ndeferred payment portion of the TCO investment totaled $709 at year-end 1993\\nand is recorded in \"Accrued liabilities\" and \"Deferred credits and other\\nnon-current obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheet. The timing of\\nthese payments is dependent on the occurrence of certain future events,\\nincluding the pace of field development and the completion and successful\\noperation of an export pipeline system. During 1993, payments related to the\\ndeferred portion of the TCO investment were classified as Repayments of\\nlong-term debt and other financing obligations\" in the consolidated statement\\nof cash flows.\\n\\nThe company\\'s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) repaid $30 and $20 of\\nmatured debt guaranteed by Chevron Corporation in 1993 and 1991,\\nrespectively. The company reflected this payment as reductions in debt\\noutstanding and in Deferred Compensation - ESOP.\\n\\nThe company refinanced an aggregate amount of $334 and $57 in tax exempt\\nlong-term debt and capital lease obligations in 1993 and 1992, respectively.\\nIn 1991, the company refinanced $970 of long-term bank notes of the ESOP\\nwith the public issuance of SEC registered long-term notes of a like amount.\\nThese refinancings are not reflected in the consolidated statement of cash\\nflows.\\n\\nIn 1992, the company received 15,750,000 shares of its common stock held by\\na stockholder in exchange for the stock of a subsidiary owning certain U.S.\\noil and gas producing properties and related facilities, cash and other\\ncurrent assets and current liabilities. The value attributed to the treasury\\nshares received was $1,100. The property exchanged consisted of properties,\\nplant and equipment with a carrying value of $790 and, excluding cash, net\\ncurrent liabilities of $1. Cash of $57 was included as a reduction of\\nproceeds from asset sales.\\n\\nIn 1992, the company acquired an additional ownership interest in an\\naffiliate, accounted for under the equity method, in a non-cash transaction.\\nThis increase in ownership required the consolidation of the affiliate into\\nthe company\\'s financial statements. The principal result of this\\nconsolidation was to increase non-current assets and liabilities by\\napproximately $64.\\n\\nThere have been other non-cash transactions that have occurred during the\\nyears presented. These include the reissuance of treasury shares for\\nmanagement compensation plans, acquisitions of properties, plant and\\nequipment through capital lease transactions, and changes in stockholders\\'\\nequity, long-term debt and other liabilities resulting from the accounting\\nfor the company\\'s ESOP.

Stockholders have been asked to approve the split and\\nan increase in authorized shares of common stock from 500 million to 1\\nbillion to accommodate the split at the annual stockholders\\' meeting on May\\n3, 1994. If approved, the split will be effective May 11, 1994 for\\nstockholders of record on that date.\\n\\nNOTE 6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\n\\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK. The company enters into forward exchange contracts,\\ngenerally with terms of 90 days or less, as a hedge against some of its\\nforeign currency exposures. Offsetting gains and losses on these contracts\\nare recognized concurrently with the exchange gains and losses stemming from\\nthe associated commitments. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the company had\\nnot recognized gains or losses on forward contracts with a carrying and\\napproximate fair value of $114 and $119, respectively.\\n\\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. The company\\'s financial instruments that are\\nexposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash\\nequivalents, marketable securities and trade receivables.\\n\\nThe company\\'s cash equivalents and marketable securities are in high-quality\\nsecurities placed with a wide array of institutions with high credit ratings.\\nThis investment policy limits the company\\'s exposure to concentrations of\\ncredit risk.\\n\\nThe trade receivable balances, reflecting the company\\'s diversified sources\\nof revenue, are dispersed among the company\\'s broad customer base worldwide.\\nAs a consequence, concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company\\nroutinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. Letters of\\ncredit are the principal security obtained to support lines of credit or\\nnegotiated contracts when the financial strength of a customer is not\\nconsidered sufficient.\\n\\nFAIR VALUE. At December 31, 1993, the company\\'s long-term debt of $2,057 had\\nan estimated fair value of $2,238. The fair value is based on quoted market\\nprices at December 31, 1993, or the present value of expected cash flows\\nwhen a quoted market price was not available.\\n\\nThe reported amounts of financial instruments such as Cash equivalents,\\nMarketable securities and Short-term debt approximate fair value because of\\ntheir short maturity.\\n\\nNOTE 7.

However,\\nthe court denied plaintiffs\\' claims to a share of any surplus plan assets.\\nIn October 1991, the district court approved a partial settlement in which\\nthe parties agreed not to appeal the partial termination claims except as\\nrelevant to plaintiffs\\' claims for a share of surplus plan assets. These\\nclaims are now before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. A second partial\\nsettlement was implemented in 1993, resulting in a charge to earnings of\\n$48.\\n\\nA lawsuit brought against the company by OXY USA Inc., the successor in\\ninterest to Cities Service Company, remains pending in an Oklahoma state\\ncourt. The suit involves claims for breach of contract and misrepresentation\\nrelated to the termination of Gulf Oil Corporation\\'s offer to purchase\\nCities\\' stock in 1982.

Eligible employees of the\\ncompany and certain of its subsidiaries who have completed one year of service\\nmay participate in the Profit Sharing/Savings Plan and the Savings Plus Plan.\\n\\nCharges to expense for the profit sharing part of the Profit Sharing/Savings\\nPlan and the Savings Plus Plan were $95, $84 and $104 in 1993, 1992 and 1991,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nEMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP).  In December 1989, the company\\nestablished an ESOP as part of the Profit Sharing/Savings Plan.  The ESOP\\nTrust Fund borrowed $1,000 and purchased 14.1 million previously unissued\\nshares of the company\\'s common stock.  The ESOP provides a partial pre-funding\\nof the company\\'s future commitments to the profit sharing part of the plan,\\nwhich will result in annual income tax savings for the company.  As interest\\nand principal payments are made on the ESOP debt, shares are released from a\\nsuspense account and allocated to profit sharing accounts of plan participants.\\n\\nThe ESOP is expected to satisfy most of the company\\'s obligations to the\\nprofit sharing part of the Profit Sharing/Savings Plan during the next 11\\nyears.  Other company obligations to the profit sharing part of the plan will\\nbe satisfied by cash contributions.  The company recorded expense for the ESOP\\nof $60, $50 and $44 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, including $74, $75\\nand $69 of interest expense related to the ESOP loan.  All dividends paid on\\nthe shares held by the ESOP will be used to service the ESOP debt.  The\\ndividends used were $47, $35 and $40 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.\\n\\nMANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLANS.  The company has two incentive plans, the\\nManagement Incentive Plan (MIP) and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for\\nofficers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its\\nsubsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility.  The MIP\\nmakes outright distributions of cash for services rendered or deferred\\nawards in the form of stock units.  Awards under LTIP may take the form of,\\nbut are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, stock units and\\nnon-stock grants.  Stock options become exercisable not earlier than one year\\nand not later than 10 years from the date of grant.\\n\\nThe maximum number of shares of common stock that may be granted each year\\nis 1 percent of the total outstanding shares of common stock as of January 1\\nof such year.  As of December 31, 1993, 2,151,505 shares were under option at\\nexercise prices ranging from $63.875 to $87.75 per share.  Stock option\\ntransactions for 1993 and 1992 are as follows:\\n\\n\\n                                    FS-27\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nNOTE 16.

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS The U.S. federal income\\ntax and California franchise tax liabilities of the company have been settled\\nthrough 1976 and 1987, respectively.  Settlement of open tax matters is not\\nexpected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of\\nthe company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been\\nmade for income and franchise taxes for all years either under examination or\\nsubject to future examination.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has asserted\\ntax deficiencies against the other three stockholders of Arabian American Oil\\nCo. (Aramco) regarding the pricing of crude oil purchased from Saudi Arabia\\nduring the period 1979 through 1981.  In December 1993, the U.S. Tax Court\\nruled in favor of Exxon and Texaco on this issue.  It is not known if the IRS\\nwill appeal this decision.  The IRS may have until late 1995 to appeal since\\nother tax issues related to the 1979-81 period must be resolved.  Chevron has\\nnot received any proposed tax deficiency concerning this issue.  In July 1991,\\nthe IRS issued a \"Designated Summons\" that requires Chevron to produce\\nadditional documents in connection with the Saudi pricing issue.  The\\nDesignated Summons extends the statutory period for assessing additional tax.\\nAs directed by the District Court, Chevron completed production of documents\\nbefore year-end 1993.  Further motions regarding compliance with the Summons\\nare expected in 1994.  After Chevron complies with the Summons, the IRS may\\npropose tax deficiencies similar to those asserted against other Aramco\\nstockholders.  The company believes that it properly accounted for the Saudi\\ncrude in its tax return and that it owes no additional U.S. taxes.\\n\\nAt December 31, 1993, the company and its subsidiaries, as direct or indirect\\nguarantors, had contingent liabilities of $234 for notes of affiliated\\ncompanies and $45 for notes of others.\\n\\nThe company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities\\nwith respect to guarantees and claims and has long-term commitments under\\nvarious agreements, the payments and future commitments for which are not\\nmaterial in the aggregate.\\n\\nIn September 1990, the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of\\nthe Interior (the Service) issued a preliminary determination letter to the\\neffect that the company owed additional royalty payments on natural gas the\\ncompany produced from federal leasehold interests and sold under long-term\\nsupply contracts.  The company made royalty payments based on the contract\\nprice received, rather than on the basis of published weighted average gas\\nprices, which were higher.  The company has submitted an answer refuting the\\npreliminary determination.  The Service has the matter under review and has\\nnot rendered an order directing payment.  However, the parties are continuing\\nto explore settlement.\\n\\nIn March 1992, an agency within the Department of Energy (DOE) issued a\\nProposed Remedial Order (PRO) claiming Chevron failed to comply with DOE\\nregulations in the course of its participation in the Tertiary Incentive\\nProgram.  Although the DOE regulations involved were rescinded in March 1981,\\nfollowing decontrol of crude oil prices in January 1981, and the statute\\nauthorizing the regulations expired in September 1981, the PRO purports to be\\nfor the period April 1980 through April 1990.  The DOE claims the company\\noverrecouped under the regulations by $125 during the period in question.\\nIncluding interest through December 1993, the total claim amounted to $273.\\nThe company asserts that in fact it incurred a loss through participation in\\nthe DOE program.  The Office of Hearings and Appeals has granted Chevron\\'s\\nmotion for evidentiary hearing and discovery.  No date has yet been set for the\\nevidentiary hearing.\\n\\nThe company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws\\nand regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to\\ncorrect or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or\\nrelease of chemical or petroleum substances by the company or other parties.\\nSuch contingencies may exist for various sites including, but not limited to:\\nSuperfund sites, operating refineries, closed refineries, oil fields, service\\nstations, terminals and land development areas.  The amount of such future cost\\nis indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible\\ncontamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that\\nmay be required, the determination of the company\\'s liability in proportion\\nto other responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are\\nrecoverable from insurance.\\n\\nThe company\\'s operations, particularly oil and gas exploration and production,\\ncan be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in\\nthe various countries, including the United States, in which it operates.  In\\ncertain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and\\ntaxes, and, in others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the\\nsafety of employees and the company\\'s continued presence in those countries.\\nInternal unrest or strained relations between a host government and the\\ncompany or other governments may affect the company\\'s operations.  Those\\ndevelopments have, at times, significantly affected the company\\'s related\\noperations and results, and are carefully considered by management when\\nevaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.\\n\\nAreas in which the company has significant operations include the United\\nStates, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, Angola, Papua New Guinea,\\nChina, Indonesia and Zaire.  The company\\'s Caltex affiliates have significant\\noperations in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand\\nand South Africa.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS\\n          RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES\\n\\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the\\nabove proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the\\nrequirements of SFAS 69. Estimated future cash inflows from production are\\ncomputed by applying year-end prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities\\nof estimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are limited to those\\nprovided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each\\nreporting year. Future development and production costs are those estimated\\nfuture expenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end estimated\\nproved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of\\nyear-end economic conditions. Estimated future income taxes are calculated\\nby applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. These rates reflect\\nallowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future\\npre-tax net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. Discounted\\nfuture net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent midperiod discount\\nfactors. This discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when the\\nfuture expenditures will be incurred and when the reserves will be produced.\\n\\nThe information provided does not represent management\\'s estimate of the\\ncompany\\'s expected future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves.\\nEstimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as\\nnew information becomes available.

Caltex\\'\\nshare of refinery inputs approximated 869,000 barrels per day in 1993.\\nCaltex continues to improve its refineries with investments designed to\\nprovide higher yields and meet environmental regulations.  Construction of a\\nnew 130,000 barrels per day refinery in Thailand is progressing with\\ncompletion anticipated in 1996.  At year end 1993, Caltex had over 7,800\\nemployees, of which about 3% were located in the United States.\\n\\nWith a strong presence in its principal operating areas, Caltex has an\\naverage market share of 17.3% with refined product sales of approximately\\n1.3 million barrels per day in 1993.  Caltex built 130 new branded retail\\noutlets during 1993 and refurbished 294 existing locations in its aim to\\nupgrade its retail distribution network.\\n\\nCaltex conducts international crude oil and refined product logistics and\\ntrading operations from a subsidiary in Singapore.  Other offices are located\\nin London, Bahrain and Tokyo.  The company has an interest in a fleet of\\nvessels and owns or has equity interests in numerous pipelines, terminals\\nand depots.  Currently, Caltex is active in the petrochemical business,\\nparticularly in Japan and South Korea.\\n\\nP. T. CALTEX PACIFIC INDONESIA (CPI)\\n- ------------------------------------\\n\\nCPI holds a Production Sharing Contract in Central Sumatra for which the\\nIndonesian government granted an extension to the year 2021 during 1992.\\nCPI also acts as operator for four other petroleum contract areas in Sumatra,\\nwhich are jointly held by Chevron and Texaco.  Exploration is pursued\\nthroughout an area comprising 2.446 million acres with production established\\nin the giant Minas and Duri fields, along with more than 80 smaller fields.\\nGross production from fields operated by CPI for 1993 was 674,000 barrels per\\nday.  CPI entitlements are sold to its shareholders, who use it in their\\nsystems or sell it to third parties.  In addition, during 1993 CPI began gas\\nexploration activities in the Nias block held jointly by Chevron and Texaco.\\nAt year end 1993, CPI had over 6,400 employees, all located in Indonesia.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   C-3\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                   CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n                      GENERAL INFORMATION\\n\\n\\n\\nAMERICAN OVERSEAS PETROLEUM LIMITED (AOPL)\\n- ------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn addition to coordinating the CPI activities, AOPL, through its subsidiary\\nAmoseas Indonesia Inc., manages Texaco\\'s and Chevron\\'s undivided interest\\nholdings which include ten contract areas in Indonesia, excluding Sumatra.\\nProduction is currently established in two contract areas, while exploration\\nis being pursued in seven others.  One in Darajat in West Java contains\\ngeothermal reserves sufficient to supply a 55-megawatt power generating\\nplant for over 30 years.  Production of the geothermal reserves is expected\\nto begin in 1994 while the state owned utility company completes construction\\nof an associated power station.  AOPL\\'s 1993 share of production amounted to\\n38,400 barrels per day.  At year end, AOPL had 281 employees, of which about\\n15% were located in the United States.\\n\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES\\n- ------------------------\\n\\nThe Group\\'s activities are subject to environmental, health and safety\\nregulations in each of the countries in which it operates.  Such regulations\\nvary significantly in degree of scope, standards and enforcement.  The\\nGroup\\'s policy is to comply with all applicable environmental, health and\\nsafety laws and regulations.  The Group has an active program to ensure its\\nenvironmental standards are maintained, which includes closely monitoring\\napplicable statutory and regulatory requirements, as well as enforcement\\npolicies, in each of the countries in which it operates, and conducting\\nperiodic environmental compliance audits.  At December 31, 1993, the Group\\nhad accrued $12 million for various remediation activities.  The\\nenvironmental guidelines and definitions promulgated by the American\\nPetroleum Institute provide the basis for reporting the Group\\'s expenditures.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 1993, the Group, including its equity share\\nof nonsubsidiary companies, incurred capital costs of $147 million and\\nnonremediation related operating expenses of $92 million.  The major\\ncomponent of the Group\\'s expenditures is for the prevention of air pollution.\\nBased upon existing statutory and regulatory requirements, investment and\\noperating plans and known exposures, the Group believes environmental\\nexpenditures will not materially affect its liquidity, financial position or\\nresults of operations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   C-4\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\\' REPORT\\n\\nTO THE STOCKHOLDERS\\nTHE CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES:\\n\\nWe have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of the Caltex Group\\nof Companies as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related combined\\nstatements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for each of the years\\nin the three-year period ended December 31, 1993.

          NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF COMBINATION\\n\\nThe combined financial statements of the Caltex Group of Companies (Group)\\ninclude the accounts of Caltex Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries,\\nAmerican Overseas Petroleum Limited and subsidiaries and P.T. Caltex Pacific\\nIndonesia after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.  A\\nsubsidiary of Chevron Corporation and two subsidiaries of Texaco Inc.\\n(stockholders) each own 50% of the outstanding common shares. The Group is\\nprimarily engaged in exploring, producing, refining and marketing crude oil\\nand refined products in the Eastern Hemisphere. The Group employs accounting\\npolicies that are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\\nin the United States.\\n\\nTRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES\\n\\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all principal subsidiary\\noperations.  Nonsubsidiary companies in Japan and Korea use the local currency\\nas the functional currency.\\n\\nINVENTORIES\\n\\nCrude oil and refined product inventories are stated at the lower of cost\\n(primarily determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method) or current\\nmarket value.  Costs include applicable purchase and refining costs, duties,\\nimport taxes, freight, etc.  Materials and supplies are valued at average\\ncost.\\n\\nINVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES\\n\\nInvestments in and advances to nonsubsidiary companies in which 20% to 50% of\\nthe voting stock is owned by the Group, or in which the Group has the ability\\nto exercise significant influence, are accounted for by the equity method.\\nUnder this method, the Group\\'s equity in the earnings or losses of these\\ncompanies is included in current results, and the related investments reflect\\nthe equity in the book value of underlying net assets.  Investments in other\\nnonsubsidiary companies are carried at cost and related dividends are reported\\nas income.\\n\\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\\n\\nExploration and production activities are accounted for under the \"successful\\nefforts\" method.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses for\\ncapitalized costs relating to the producing area, including intangible\\ndevelopment costs, are computed using the unit-of-production method.\\n\\nAll other assets are depreciated by class on a uniform straight line basis.\\nDepreciation rates are based upon the estimated useful life of each class of\\nproperty.  In view of the numerous depreciation classifications, it is not\\npractical to provide a schedule of depreciation rates.\\n\\nMaintenance and repairs necessary to maintain facilities in operating\\ncondition are charged to income as incurred.  Additions and betterments that\\nmaterially extend the life of properties are capitalized.  Upon disposal of\\nproperties, any net gain or loss is included in other income.\\n\\n                                  C-10\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                        CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                 NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED\\n\\nDEFERRED INCOME TAXES\\n\\nEffective January 1, 1992, deferred income taxes are recognized according to\\nthe asset and liability method specified in Statement of Financial Accounting\\nStandards (SFAS) No. 109 \"Accounting for Income Taxes\" by applying individual\\njurisdiction tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the\\nfinancial statement and tax basis carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.\\nThe effect of tax rate changes on previously recorded deferred taxes is\\nrecognized in the current year.  Deferred income taxes for 1991 were\\nrecognized under the method specified in SFAS No. 96.\\n\\nNo provision has been made for possible income taxes that might be payable if\\naccumulated earnings of subsidiary companies and nonsubsidiary companies\\naccounted for by the equity method were distributed, since such earnings have\\nbeen or are intended to be indefinitely reinvested.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\\n\\nCompliance with environmental regulations is determined in relation to the\\nexisting laws in each of the countries in which the Group operates and the\\nGroup\\'s own internal standards.  The Group capitalizes expenditures that\\ncreate future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation.\\nRemediation costs are accrued based on estimates of known environmental\\nexposure even if uncertainties exist about the ultimate cost of the\\nremediation.  Such accruals are based on the best available nondiscounted\\nestimated costs using data developed by third party experts.  Costs of\\nenvironmental compliance for past and ongoing operations, including\\nmaintenance and monitoring, are expensed as incurred.  Recoveries from third\\nparties are recorded as assets when realization is determined to be probable.\\n\\nRECLASSIFICATIONS\\n\\nCertain amounts have been reclassified for preceding periods to conform with\\nthe current year\\'s presentation.\\n\\n(2) INVENTORIES\\n\\nThe excess of current cost over the stated value of inventory maintained on\\nthe LIFO basis was approximately $40 million and $91 million at December 31,\\n1993 and 1992, respectively.  The reduction of LIFO inventories in certain\\ncountries resulted in an increase in the earnings of consolidated\\nsubsidiaries and nonsubsidiary companies at equity of approximately $1\\nmillion in 1993.  Previous reductions in LIFO inventories resulted in a\\ndecrease in earnings of $2 million in 1992 and an increase in earnings of $4\\nmillion in 1991.\\n\\nCharges of $104 million and $25 million reduced income in 1993 and 1991,\\nrespectively, to reflect a market value of certain inventories lower than\\ntheir LIFO carrying value.  Earnings of $14 million were recorded in 1992 to\\nreflect a partial recovery of the 1991 charge.\\n\\n                                  C-11\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                           CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                    NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n(3) NONSUBSIDIARY COMPANIES AT EQUITY\\n\\nInvestments in and advances to nonsubsidiary companies at equity at December\\n31 include the following (in millions):\\n\\n                                           Equity Share      1993       1992\\n                                           ------------     ------     ------\\n  Nippon Petroleum Refining Company, Ltd.       50%         $  829     $  727\\n  Koa Oil Company, Ltd.                         50%            310        268\\n  Honam Oil Refinery Company, Ltd.              50%            423        357\\n  All other                                   Various          234         75\\n                                                            ------     ------\\n                                                            $1,796     $1,427\\n                                                            ======     ======\\n\\nShown below is summarized combined financial information for these non-\\nsubsidiary companies (in millions):\\n\\n                                100%                 Equity Share\\n                         ----------------         -----------------\\n                           1993      1992           1993       1992\\n                         ------    ------         ------     ------\\n\\n  Current assets         $4,680    $5,149         $2,316     $2,564\\n  Other assets            6,147     4,851          2,975      2,410\\n\\n  Current liabilities     4,900     4,946          2,349      2,470\\n  Other liabilities       2,306     2,173          1,146      1,078\\n\\n  Net worth               3,621     2,881          1,796      1,426\\n\\n\\n                                      100%                   Equity Share\\n                          -------------------------    ----------------------\\n                             1993     1992     1991      1993    1992    1991\\n                          -------  -------  -------    ------  ------  ------\\n  Operating revenues      $10,679  $10,502  $10,267    $5,304  $5,216  $5,102\\n  Operating income            494      645      839       242     319     416\\n  Net income                  281      326      380       140     163     188\\n\\nRetained earnings at December 31, 1993, includes $1.2 billion representing the\\nGroup\\'s share of undistributed earnings of nonsubsidiary companies at equity.\\n\\nCash dividends received from these nonsubsidiary companies were $37 million,\\n$30 million, and $26 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.\\n\\nSales to the other 50 percent owner of Nippon Petroleum Refining Company, Ltd.\\nof products refined by Nippon Petroleum Refining Company, Ltd. and Koa Oil\\nCompany, Ltd. were approximately $1.9 billion, $2 billion, and $2.1 billion\\nin 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.\\n\\n                                     C-12\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                        CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                 NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n(4)  NOTES PAYABLE\\n\\nInformation regarding short-term financing, consisting primarily of demand\\nloans, promissory notes, acceptance credits and overdrafts, is shown below\\n(dollars in millions):\\n\\n                       Weighted       Maximum              Weighted Average\\n                        Average     Outstanding   Average     Interest Rate\\n      Borrowings At  Interest Rate    At Any      Amount        On Average\\n        Year End      At Year End    Month End  Outstanding    Outstanding\\n      -------------  -------------  ----------  -----------  --------------\\n1993      $966           4.7%         $1,041        $902           4.6%\\n1992       830           5.0           1,063         898           5.7\\n1991       907           7.2             996         875           9.9\\n\\nUnutilized lines of credit available for short-term financing totaled $814\\nmillion at December 31, 1993.\\n\\n(5)  LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS\\n\\nLong-term debt and capital lease obligations, with related interest rates at\\nDecember 31, 1993, consist of the following (in millions):\\n\\n                                                              1993       1992\\n U.S. dollars:                                                ----       ----\\n     Variable interest rate term loans                        $173       $155\\n     Fixed interest rate term loans with 7.6% average rate     220        205\\n   Australian dollars:\\n     Debentures with interest rates at 12.5% due 1995 -

The plans which provide these benefits are\\nunfunded.  As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, the accumulated postretirement\\nbenefit obligation amounted to $47 million and $43 million, respectively,\\nwith related accruals of $44 million and $43 million, respectively.  The net\\nperiodic postretirement benefit costs amounted to $6 million for each of the\\nyears ending December 31, 1993 and 1992.\\n\\nIn November 1992 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.\\n112 \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits.\"  This new standard\\nrequires companies to accrue, no later than 1994, for the cost for benefits\\nprovided to former or inactive employees after employment but prior to\\nretirement.  Adoption of this new standard is not expected to materially\\nimpact the combined financial statements of the Group.\\n\\n(7) OPERATING LEASES\\n\\nThe Group has various operating leases involving service stations, equipment\\nand other facilities for which net rental expense was $110 million, $95\\nmillion, and $53 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.\\n\\nFuture net minimum rental commitments under operating leases having\\nnoncancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows (in millions):\\n1994 - $42; 1995 - $42; 1996 - $42; 1997 - $37; 1998 - $31; 1999 and\\nthereafter - $146.\\n\\n(8) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\\n\\nOn January 25, 1990, Caltex Petroleum Corporation and certain of its\\nsubsidiaries were named as defendants, along with privately held Philippine\\nferry and shipping companies and the shipping company\\'s insurer, in a lawsuit\\nfiled in Houston, Texas State Court.  After removal to Federal District Court\\nin Houston, the litigation\\'s disposition turned on questions of federal court\\njurisdiction and whether the case should be dismissed for forum non\\nconveniens.  The plaintiffs\\' petition purported to be a class action on\\nbehalf of at least 3,350 parties, who were either survivors of, or next of\\nkin of persons deceased in a collision in Philippine waters on December 20,\\n1987.  One vessel involved in the collision was carrying Group products in\\nconnection with a freight contract.  Although the Group had no direct or\\nindirect ownership or operational responsibility for either vessel, various\\ntheories of liability were alleged against the Group.  No specific monetary\\nrecovery was sought although the petition contained a variety of demands for\\nvarious categories of compensatory as well as punitive damages.  These issues\\nwere resolved in the Group\\'s favor by the Federal District Court in March\\n1992, and that decision is now final.  However, the plaintiffs had\\nseparately filed another lawsuit, alleging the same causes of action as in\\nthe Texas litigation, in Louisiana State Court in New Orleans in late 1988\\nbut never served the Group until late December of 1993, after the decision\\nin the Texas litigation became final.  Subsequent to receipt of the service,\\nthe Group has removed this case to Federal District Court in New Orleans and\\nhas moved for its dismissal.  Management is contesting this case vigorously.\\nIt is not possible to estimate the amount of damages involved, if any.\\n\\nThe Group may be subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws\\nand regulations in each of the countries in which it operates that, in the\\nfuture, may require the Group to take action to correct or remediate the\\neffects on the environment of prior disposal or release of petroleum\\nsubstances by the Group.  The amount of such future cost is indeterminable\\ndue to such factors as the nature of the new regulations, the unknown\\nmagnitude of any possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of\\nthe corrective actions that may be required, and the extent to which such\\ncosts are recoverable from third party insurance.\\n\\n                                      C-15\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                           CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                     NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n(8) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES - Continued\\n\\nThe Group is also involved in certain other litigation and Internal Revenue\\nService tax audits that could involve significant payments if such items are\\nall ultimately resolved adversely to the Group.\\n\\nWhile it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial\\nliability with respect to the above mentioned contingent liabilities, the\\naggregate amount that may arise from such liabilities is not anticipated to\\nbe material in relation to the Group\\'s combined financial position, results\\nof operations, or liquidity.\\n\\n(9)FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\n\\nCertain Group companies are parties to financial instruments with off-balance\\nsheet credit and market risk, principally interest rate risk.  As of December\\n31, the Group had commitments outstanding for interest rate swaps and foreign\\ncurrency transactions for which the notional or contractual amounts are as\\nfollows (in millions):\\n\\n                                                              1993       1992\\n                                                              ----       ----\\n      Interest rate swaps                                     $344       $317\\n      Commitments to purchase foreign currencies              $338       $141\\n      Commitments to sell foreign currencies                  $ 89       $ 20\\n\\nThe interest rate swaps are intended to hedge against fluctuations in interest\\nrates on debt, and their effects are recognized in the statement of income at\\nthe same time as the interest expense on the debt to which they relate.\\n\\nCommitments to purchase and sell foreign currencies are made to provide\\nexchange rate protection for specific transactions and to maximize economic\\nbenefit based on expected currency movements.  The above purchase and sale\\ncommitments are at year end exchange rates and mature during the following\\nyear.  These commitments are marked to market and the resulting gains and\\nlosses are recognized in current year income unless the contract is a specific\\nhedge of an identifiable transaction.  There were no material differences\\nbetween the notional and estimated fair value for these commitments.\\n\\nThe Group\\'s long-term debt, excluding capital lease obligations, of $497\\nmillion and $453 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, had fair\\nvalues of $511 million and $462 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992,\\nrespectively. The fair value estimates were based on the present value of\\nexpected cash flows discounted at current market rates for similar\\nobligations.  The reported amounts of financial instruments such as Cash and\\ncash equivalents, Notes and accounts receivable, and all current liabilities\\napproximate fair value because of their short maturity.\\n\\nCertain Group companies were contingently liable as guarantors for $7\\nmillion and $12 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The\\nGroup also had commitments of $36 million and $96 million at December 31,\\n1993 and 1992, respectively, in the form of letters of credit which have\\nbeen issued on behalf of Group companies to facilitate either the Group\\'s or\\nother parties\\' ability to trade in the normal course of business.\\n\\nFinancial instruments exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade\\nreceivables.  These receivables are dispersed among the countries in which\\nthe Group operates, thus limiting concentrations of such risk.\\n\\nThe Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally\\ndoes not require collateral.  Letters of credit are the principal security\\nobtained to support lines of credit when the financial strength of a customer\\nor country is not considered sufficient.  Credit losses have been\\nhistorically within management\\'s expectations.\\n\\n                                     C-16\\n<PAGE>\\n<PAGE>\\n                          CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES\\n\\n                   NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n(10) OTHER INCOME/DEDUCTIONS\\n\\nIn 1991, dividends, interest and other income included gains from asset sales\\non a before and after tax basis of $200 million and $120 million, respectively.\\nAsset sales in 1993 and 1992 were not significant.\\n\\nNet foreign exchange (exclusive of the currency translation adjustment) for\\nconsolidated subsidiaries and nonsubsidiary companies at equity, after\\napplicable income taxes, amounted to gains of $32 million and $43 million in\\n1993 and 1992, respectively.
